When she resists, in a fit of rage, he pronounces Talaq thrice. Local Mullah says this meant a real divorce and Noor has to leave her husband's house. Mullah suggests that in order for Rashid and Noor to be a couple, Quran has a way out and it's called Nikah Halaala - where a woman, after divorced by triple talaq, marries another man, consummates marriage, gets divorced again to remarry her former husband. Though Noor tearfully treads this slippery slope to get back to her husband and kids, society at large has other plans.",
