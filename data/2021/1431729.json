    "synopsis": [
        "Meghna(Sonali Kulkarni), a news correspondent in Delhi,\u00a0one day receives\u00a0a videotape from a remote place in central India. On the tape, a battered young man claims to be the real Mohandas and alleges that someone else has stolen his\u00a0identity. Someone else is living as 'Mohandas'.\n\u00a0Intrigued by what looks like an unusual small-town scam, Meghna makes\u00a0 a trip to Anuppur. There,\u00a0 she unearths a more harrowing and surreal story. Mohandas(Nakul Vaid) is a topper in studies from the poor community of basket-weavers and is overjoyed at long last when he is selected for a good white-collar post in Oriental Coal Mines. But he is kept waiting and waiting to actually get the job. Long afterwards, when he has given up and reconciled to it, he learns that someone else has\u00a0 assumed his name and has already taken his job! \u00a0When he rushes to protest, he is beaten up and thrown out.\u00a0 Meghna places this story in the media. Harshvardhan(Aditya Srivastava), a lawyer from the district, takes this case of stolen identity to court with the intention of hauling up the usurper. With more bizarre results.A Kafkaesque tale of identity theft that becomes a searing indictment of bureaucratic corruption and conspiracy."
