        "It's nice to see it as a suspense movie and not a horror one. There are a lot of horror-like scenes and they are definitely scary, the sound combination, the filming, the lighting scheme etc are very nice. Everyone has done great acting. Such and complete horror is still expected in Marathi,::evikramsiha"
