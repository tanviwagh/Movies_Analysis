SATYA also targets International Businessman DEVENDRA and robs all his money, collections, and business dealings. The chase canvas becomes International. SATYA plays a cat and mouse game with INTERPOL and the Villain DEVENDRA. During this ACP KISHORE who is in jail comes to help both the INTERPOL and DEVENDRA to nab SATYA. Will ACP KISHORE succeed in taking revenge on SATYA? Will SATYA again manages to escape and frame ACP KISHORE as a culprit? Will INTERPOL catch the con-man SATYA? Will the Villain DEVENDRA find out who is this SATYA and why he has looted him?... the answers to all this forms the screenplay of K-3 which is a racy action entertainer with an array of characters coming in to entertain the audience with a full dose of comedy, twists, and turns.
