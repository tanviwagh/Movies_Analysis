        "It's love at first sight when Madhav Shastri aka Maddy (R. Madhavan) first glimpses the beautiful Reena Malhotra (Diya Mirza). Thereafter he meets her again and finds out that she the betrothed to Rajiv. Maddy impersonates Rajiv and enters Reena's life. And they both fall in love. Then American-settled Rajiv Samra (Saif Ali Khan), who used to know Madhav from college, comes to India to marry Reena. Reena is shocked to find out that the one she has given her heart out to is a fraud. Accordingly, she decides not to do anything with him, and lets her parents (Maya Alagh and Navin Nischal) go ahead with the arranged marriage with Rajiv (or Sam). Maddy is devastated and he confronts Reena, but Reena refuses to have anything to do with him. That's when he decides to go to the US, to forget Reena and start life afresh...::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
