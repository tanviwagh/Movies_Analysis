In his free time, when he's not busy being an amateur butcher, Tony enjoys watching VHS action films on a small and obsolete TV, querying escort agencies and prostitutes about their services and prices, meeting new and interesting people on the streets and in gay bars, and taking long walks by the waterside, where he dumps body parts. Tony enjoys the occasional beer and a toke of crack, and is a non-smoker. He's lonely, badly in need of a cuddle, and would love to have you over for a powdered fruit drink and an uncomfortable and mundane chat and that bit of warmth that a corpse just can't provide.",
