Soon both get married. Kumar is ambitious, and wants to become the head of this town. He organizes his campaign and successfully gets himself elected, not without creating some enemies. After this election, Kumar keeps busy with his new-found duties, but Prerna notices a change in him - as he is fast becoming the man he hated the most - the former zamindar.",
