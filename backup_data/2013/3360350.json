However, she is unable to see the scar that it has left on Rohit's life. He too, is damaged and alone. Anu's and Rohit's kids attend the same school. A sports injury suffered by Anu's elder daughter serves as a pretext for them to meet, and it blossoms into a new sort of bond for the both of them.",
