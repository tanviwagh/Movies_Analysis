        "Preman \"Fahadh Faasil\" is the caretaker of a flat at Cochin. Everyone in the flat calls him 'Natholi'. He faces some unfortunate events in the flat and begins to write a story with the same characters in his real life and plays with their lives in his story. The film revolves around the story of the conflict between Preman and the character he creates. He gradually loses control over the character he creates and it begins to act on its own. The rest of the movie is a display of Preman trying to wrest back control of his character and the ensuing plot twists.::Kris Paul"
