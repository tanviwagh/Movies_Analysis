        "A new re-telling of the adventures of the famous character from The Arabian Nights stories. Sinbad, along with his elder brother and an assorted band of companions, sets sail from Baghdad in search of adventure and riches. Along the way the voyagers encounter strange tribes, evil wizards and giant sea monsters intent on making an appetizer of their ship.::Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>",
        "Two years after having been swept away in a storm and awakening to find a mysterious bracelet strapped to his wrist, the famous captain sets off on new voyages. Sinbad assembles a crew with his impulsive elder brother Doubar which includes the under appreciated inventor/man of sciene Firouz, the silent warrior Rongar, a Celtic woman named Maeve (the apprentice of Sinbad's magician mentor Dim Dim), and her beloved guardian hawk Dermott. Later to join the crew is an enigma of a woman known as Bryn. Dim Dim's disappearence and a constant battle with a witch named Rumina, who holds a connection to Maeve and Dermott, causes the crew to travel distant lands, fighting tyrants and monsters, all the while trying to keep magic and adventure alive in the world.::Max Vaughn"
