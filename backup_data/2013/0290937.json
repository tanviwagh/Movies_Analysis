        "Ashokan is a village fellow who is always in competition with his cousin Appukkuttan. Ashokan is sent to Nepal to meet his uncle as an astrologer predicts that if he stays at home, he will commit a murder. Once there, he finds that Appukuttan has already reached there claiming that he was Ashokan. There, he loses his luggage and is shunned off to streets where he is joined by the Rinpoche, the Sacred Boy of one of the monasteries, who escaped from his tormentors. The evil forces try to kidnap the child, and Mohanlal is drawn into the fight.::gavin (gunmasterM@hotmail.com)"
