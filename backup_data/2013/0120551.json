        "It is the story of a hot-tempered and stubborn man Deva, who is feared because of his ruthless ways and severe punishment to the local hoodlums. Later, Deva avenges the death of his brother and sister.",
        "Omnipresent Bollywood acting dynamo Sunny Deol stars as Deva, the son of an honest lawyer (Anupam Kher) who lives with his brother, Aakash (Sachin Khedekar), and his beloved sister, Guddi (Richa Behl). Imprisoned after a man touches Guddi and sets off his violent, jealous rage, Deva falls into a life of crime, quickly rising to the top of the city's criminal underworld--much to the chagrin of the other crime bosses, who plot his murder.

        "Deva Pradhan comes from a middle-class family consisting of his advocate dad Ashok, sister Guddi and brother Akash. Deva gets a long jail term for murdering a man who attempt to molest Guddi; after returning from jail Deva's life changes into that of a gangster albeit with a good heart. His adventures leads him to not only get trapped in the murder of Akash and Guddi but of abducting the Chief Minister - with Deva all set to clear his name he must prove to the authorities that all the accusations laid against him are false.::gavin (racktoo@hotmail.com)",
        "Deva, after a turbulant youth as a dispenser of violent street justice (including going to jail for ripping a man's arm off for the crime of grabbing Deva's sister's hand) has emerged from jail and risen to become one of the lords of the underworld. The top isn't so lonely, however, as three other crime bosses are all looking to put him out of business and take over his gold smuggling operation. Police chief Inder, the brother of the man Deva maimed (and now husband of Deva's sister) is also intent on putting an end to his brother-in-law's criminal ways.::Jean-Marc Rocher <rocher@fiberbit.net>",
        "Deva Pradhan lives with his Advocate dad, brother Akash, and sister, Guddi, and comes from a middle-class background. Deva is known and feared for his uncontrollable temper, stubbornness, in particular being overly protective of Guddi. One day he witnesses a man attempting to molest his sister, and he brutally beats him. As a result he is arrested by the police, shunned by his father, and imprisoned. On his return, Deva has acquired new skills in prison, and becomes a dreaded gangster. His sister gets married to Asst. Commissioner of Police, Inder Saxena, and this increases the rift between him and his family. Then Akash is killed, and the only clue left behind is the topper of a ballpoint pen - but before that Deva must himself prove to the authorities that he was not involved in this murder. Before he could even do that, Guddi is killed, and the evidence points at Deva. The police launch a manhunt for him, and in response, Deva abducts the State's Chief Minister. Deva must now unravel the mystery behind the deaths of his brother and sister, and clarify to the world as to how the Chief Minister became his hostage.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
