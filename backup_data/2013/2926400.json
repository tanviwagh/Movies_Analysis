    "plot outline": "Set in late 1950s the film uses the symbols of Serpentine Worship and socio political rebellions during that period of time to create an ambience for storytelling. The protagonist Dasan was a practicing Pulluvan, who had an aura of ascribed divinity around him. He had two wives, Janaki and Chakara. Janaki's love with Dasan was platonic, but Chakara true to her name was possessive. Dasan along the course of time becomes passionate with Devaki Antharjanam, the wife of the village landlord as well. Be it wine, women or smoke, Dasan had no restrictions. His mastery over the profession was unparalleled. Due to the ascribed divinity around him, he was unquestioned. But not for too long, something happens which makes his life topsy turvy! The event also brings out the tenacity and quality of relations he had. The film picturises the various shades of love and problemetises the conventional concepts around it. Its also an attempt to transcend the definitions of love and to explore the flowering of bonds which are deep rooted than love. What do we call it?",
