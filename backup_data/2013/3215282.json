        "Two warring villages have a history of enmity with their chieftains being at loggerheads for generations. So we have the new generation tearing at each other's throats too.

        "'_Desingu Raja_ (qv)' is a rural comedy meant for mass audiences. It is a laugh riot set in the backdrop of two villages which are constantly at conflict with one another. Vimal plays the lead named Idhayakani whose primary identity is that he is a diehard MGR fan. The female lead, Bindu Madhavi, plays a cheerful, naughty village girl who is a Rajini fanatic. When these two, belonging to two rival villages fall in love, they set in motion an hilariously humorous and chaotic sequence of events that forms the crux of the movie.::Santhosh"
