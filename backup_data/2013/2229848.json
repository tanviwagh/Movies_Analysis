Siddharth is very studious and spends most of his time with books whereas Omi and Jai are busy in chasing girls, watching movies or dramas; only common thing among them is smoking. One day Omi and Jai see a girl who is new to their neighborhood and try to impress her by their tricks; they give up when both of them experience shameful events. After some days, Neha shows up as Chamko washing powder salesgirl to their flat, upon seeing whom Jai and Omi hide quickly. Siddharth sees Neha for the first time and a love story begins. But when his two friends find out, they decide to put an end to their relationship as a revenge to the embarrassment inflicted upon them by the girl. Initially they succeed in separating Siddharth and Neha but later on repent when they find that Siddharth lost his interest in work and study and also likely to end his life. Finally they decide to reunite both. The parallel plot runs between Omi, Jai, Siddharth and Lallan Miyan. Lallan Miyan is the local shopkeeper who sells Cigarettes to Omi and Jai on credit. But as students don't clear his debts, Lallan Miyan tries to follow-up with them to get their dues. A spate of kidnapping (especially of young girls) has started in Delhi. One fine day Omi and his friends along with Neha's grandmother plan to stage a fake kidnapping and get married. But unfortunately she is kidnapped by the real gang and the duo is left in a lurch. The later part of the story revolves how they clear the confusion that she has been in fact kidnapped by real thugs and how she is rescued.",
