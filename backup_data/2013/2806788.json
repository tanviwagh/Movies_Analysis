Indulgence in all the little pleasures that a carefree life has to offer.

More so, when you really need to get admission in the coolest college in town and you know you dont deserve it. And to top that, you get yourself involved in the most bizarre situations that could crack you into pieces before you could crack it.FUKREY is one such crazy story of four restless and hapless souls, running after their individual desires, brought together by one dream, which turns their not so simple life upside down. From breaking school walls, to cross dressing dancers at the Ram Lila; from a Jugaad Baaz college watchman to leaking examination papers; from a female pimp, who runs her drug cartel through Nigerian henchmen to visionary dreams.Can the four Fukrey, the four nobodies, twist their fate and dreams into reality or will they forever be lost in the obscurity that they come from?"
