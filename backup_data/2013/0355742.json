Though Abhiram does not like a girl joining his company, he has to live with it as the appointment is made by his uncle (Tanikella Bharani). He starts mistreating her. Harika, vexed by Abhiram's acts, submits her resignation to Abhi's uncle, who then narrates the flashback of Abhiram to Harika. Abhi is born with a golden spoon. Abhi is raised by his grandfather (Balayya) as his parents die soon after the birth of Abhi. Abhi falls in love with Maheswari (Anshu), who is the niece of an employee (Chandra Mohan) in Abhi's grandfather's company. Alarmed by this, Chandra Mohan takes her away to his home town and arranges pelli choopulu with another guy. Abhi travels all the way to the venue and takes Maheswari away. While traveling back, they met with an accident. After 10 days, when Abhi comes out of coma, he is told that Maheswari is about to marry some other guy. Shocked by this news, Abhi develops hatred towards women. After narrating the flashback, Abhi's uncle promotes Harika to Manager position and demotes Abhi to Assistant Manager position.
