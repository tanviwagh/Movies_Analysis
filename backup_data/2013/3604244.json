        "'_Kadhaveedu_ (qv)' is a dedication to Malayalam being accorded the Shresthabhaasha (Malayalam has been declared a Classical language in 2013) status and presents, as a single entity, three different stories penned by the doyens of Malayalam literature - Vaikkom Muhammed Basheer, M T Vasudevan Nair and Madhavikutty.::_Kadhaveedu_ (qv):Signature of Malayalam",
        "'_Kadhaveedu_ (qv)' shares the beauty, shams and relevance of matrimony, presented from the perspective of its protagonist, a filmmaker who seeks answers to a very personal question... '_Kadhaveedu_ (qv)' delves into almost every aspect of marriage and married life. The love and the hate that seeps into matrimony, the disparities relating to individual tastes, the sense of loss that follows the death of a partner and much more is discussed in the film. The film pans realities inside the house and zooms in on the proximities as well as the distances that are part of every relationship, plus the tumbling and eventual ruin that sometimes is integral to matrimony.::Unni R.Nair"
