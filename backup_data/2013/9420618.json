        "_Rangbaaz_ (qv) Phirse is the second season of ZEE5's flagship franchise _Rangbaaz_ (qv). The series stars Jimmy Sheirgill, Gul Panag, Sharad Kelkar, Spruha Joshi, Harsh Chhaya and Sushant Singh. It is the story of a young guy who falls through the cracks of the society because of ulterior political agendas and is robbed of his youth which subsequently ruins his life. #NotBornACriminal This season will be based on the story of Amarpal Singh, a feared gangster of Rajasthan. It will revolve around his journey into the world of crime. A product of caste supremacy and political rivalry, Amarpal Singh's story is an unusual tale of a dream gone so wrong that it couldn't be rectified after a point - a dream of excelling in every field, a dream of setting an example in the society, a dream of being the best ever."
