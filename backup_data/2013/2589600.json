        "The film is a slice of life drama based in Hyderabad. It is a story about friends, who are from different parts of India & have come to live together. The texture tries to capture the old world charm in uber modern surroundings. It is a lighthearted depiction of self discovery, adventure, growing up, friendships and optimism. The film is set against the backdrop of an impending bike rally!::Anonymous"
