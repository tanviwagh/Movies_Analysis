Deciding to up the ante, the dynamic political leader R.G, who had unleashed the CID sleuths, sends in a CBI officer (Mithun Chakraborty) to Mumbai to get to the bottom of things. However, what the officer discovers is that the gang-war is merely a fa\u00c3\u00a7ade to find out about a heist, in which two truckloads of hard cash were stolen from Memon, who will stop at nothing to get his money back. The question is - who is crazy enough to steal from the king of the city underworld? Thus begins a cat-and-mouse game between the characters of the film that keeps the story line interesting right to the logical end of the film.",
