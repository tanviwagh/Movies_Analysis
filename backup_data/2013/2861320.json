    "synopsis": "A cop named DCP Rudra is transferred to a new police station. As the city is riddled with crime and corruption, he decides to bring law and order back for which he has to go against Nagori Subramaniam the local mafia. He does not believe in the system of going by the book and instead fights fire with fire.The movie was rumoured to be called Thanedaar - Part 2, referring to a previous hit movie of Sanjay Dutt did during his younger days. However Dutt did not feel comfortable with the movie backing on the success of Thanedaar, considering the fact that the story was not written keeping in mind the original Thanedaar. Furthermore the directors and producers of the original Thanedaar were different. Subsequently Sanjay Dutt suggested to brainstorm for another name. He suggested Policegiri and the unit was happy to call this movie Policegiri. Policegiri was actually not a word in use but something Sanjay Dutt created.[1]"
