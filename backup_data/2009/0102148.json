        "Durgeshwari Devi is a authoritarian, and lives in a palatial home with her daughter, Rekha, and two sons, Dheeraj and Neeraj. She permits her brother, nicknamed DDT, and his close friend, also nicknamed BBC, to live in her home, along-with her personal secretary, Shakti alias Pappu. She would like Rekha to get married to an equally wealthy family, but instead Rekha falls in love with a street-smart poor man named Raja, who though educated, is unemployed. Hoping to dissuade him from marrying Rekha, she tells him that she is prepared to give her consent to this marriage if he is willing to stay on in her home as a \"ghar jamai\" (recognized as a taboo in India). But her plans are foiled when Raja readily agrees to this condition, and in this way the marriage takes place. But the Raja's tests and trails have just begun - for Durgeshwari has no plans to have him staying at her home for long - and together with DDT, BBC, and Pappu, she plans a vicious and devious plot to ensnare Raja, which will lower his esteem in Rekha's eyes, and then have him thrown out of her house. But Raja, too, has some tricks up his sleeve, making it crystal clear that he is not an easy game - and can wove his own web to ensnare the wily Durgeshwari and her clan.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
