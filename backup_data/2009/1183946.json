But when more pavement dwellers are killed only between the hours of 10 PM and 4 AM in the Sion - Matunga Harbor Line area on Tuesdays and Saturdays, they review their decision and conclude this to be the work of a serial killer. Sanjay approaches A.I.G. Satam and pleads with him to handle this incident but is told that he cannot do so as he has been fired. When he insists, Satam asks him to do this on his own, and if successful, he will approach Mantralaya and have him reinstated. A grateful Sanjay commences his investigation - not aware that soon he will himself become a suspect after police come across evidence linking him to these killings.",
