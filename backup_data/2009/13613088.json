    "plot outline": "The film begins with Guru (Guru) in a serious condition being rushed to the hospital. Some goons kidnap him from his hospital bed and throw him in a lake. Guru was a struggling photographer who was a known professional for his work and nature. After initial quarrels with the college student and orphan Nisha (Asha), they fell in love with each other. One night, Guru takes a wounded Eashwar (Babu) to the nearby hospital. The next day, being thankful for his help, Eashwar gave him the opportunity to work for his modelling studio and Guru accepted it. Meanwhile, Eashwar's assistant Sobikha (Sara) then proposed her love to Guru but Guru told her that he was in love with Nisha. Eashwar was, in reality, a pervert who had raped many innocent girls. One day, Nisha and her friends were invented by Guru for a photo shoot and as usual, in the dressing room, the hidden camera videotaped Nisha changing her clothes. Eashwar then blackmailed her in his studio and even tried to rape her, but Guru came to her rescue and during the fight, Eashwar was stabbed and he died. Back to the present, Periyavar's enemies recover Guru from the lake and save his life. Periyavar (M. Pazhamudhir Murugan), Eashwar's father, is an influential man who runs an orphanage and every night a girl from the orphanage was kidnapped by Eashwar. Guru comes to know that Nisha has left her hostel. In the meantime, Periyavar, who thought that Guru stabbed his son, finds out via the videotape that Nisha was the one who killed his son. Guru then finds Nisha in Sobikha's house and decides to elope with her. A vengeful Periyavar kills Nisha and Guru murders him in turn. The film ends with a saddened Guru committing suicide by drowning in the river with Nisha's body.",
