        "Delhi-based Hakeem Tarachand reveals the story of hapless U.S.-returned Nikhil; his conservative Punjabi Hindu father, Purshotam; mom and grandmother; and disbelief when they find out that Nikhil is in love with a Caucasian girl, Nikki Abbot, while being totally unaware that his true love is Aamna, who will never be accepted by his family due to her being a Muslim. Hoping to divert attention and expose the fickleness and lack of family commitment of Caucasians, Nikhil and Tarachand hope to convince the family that Aamna maybe better suited as his bride. Hilarious chaos results when the entire family ironically accept Nikki as Nikhil's future bride.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
