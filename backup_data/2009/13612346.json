    "plot outline": "In a remote village near Madurai, the happy-go-lucky man Arivu (Bala Joseph) and the village belle Uma (Vishaka) fall in love with each other. Arivu is the son of the village bigwig Mandakalai (Saikumar), while Uma is the daughter of the postman Manikkam (Thalaivasal Vijay). When Mandakalai knew about his son's love affair, he sends his cousin Duraisingam (Thennavan) and his henchmen to kill Uma, but Arivu saves her. The lovers consume poison and go separated, getting into different trains moving at opposite directions. Arivu is then admitted to the hospital and saved by the doctors. Mandakalai's henchmen cannot find the missing girl Uma, and the villagers conclude that she died. The heartbroken Arivu with his friends moves to Chennai to try to forget this mishap. One day, Arivu's friends witness Uma in a temple, but Dr. Shyam (Shyam Ganesh) tells them that she is not Uma, thinking that they might be Mandakalai's henchmen. Uma is now living in Shyam's house but is afraid of returning home, so Shyam invites her parents at his home. When Uma and her parents return to their village, they come to know that Arivu committed suicide. Arivu was moved after the \"death\" of his lover, but he acted happy and positive to his friends and family. Uma is aghast to hear this news, and she decides to not get married. Every year, at the death anniversary of her lover, Uma places flower garlands at the burial place of Arivu.",
