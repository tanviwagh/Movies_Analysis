    "synopsis": "In Fuzion Bollywood style with mostly Hindi but some English words used by the actors, beautiful songs with English subtitles and lyrics displayed. A good romantic yarn. Akshay, an aspiring artist, meets Sanjana, a beautiful lively wealthy young woman, and they fall in love. But he does not have much money and intense feelings that he cannot really express in words. When he wants to go to Australia for a great job offer, he does not understand that Sanjana cannot really follow him and give up all her current world, if he does not marry her. He feels he is not yet in a position to marry. They break up. Years later they meet on a plane, and as disaster strikes in Mumbai Akshay can only think of one thing: to try and find and save Sanjana whilst the waters are rising. Even if he is now successful and having the most important meeting of his career. And then he finally learns to express his feelings in words."
