Things escalate to such an extent that Baabarr is forced to flee to his wife, Afreen, in Kolkata, where he is eventually traced and brought before the courts. This is where the Uttar Pradesh police will experience frustration when the court holds Baabarr in judicial custody forbidding the police to even lay a hand on him. With over 200 incidents, virtually no witnesses nor evidence to tie him to any crime, it does look as if Baabaar, who has acquired heroic status and many followers, may eventually be acquitted and free to carry on his reign in Amanganj.",
