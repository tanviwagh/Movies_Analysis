    "synopsis": "A bubbly tale, the story is about four pairs of students (Pradeep, Praveen, Vishwas, Spoorthi, Ruthika, Raghavendra, Aishwarya Nag, Keerthi Ballal) who get into the engineering college. Each of them have got their own thinking and as expected, even the tales of romance blooms between the lead students. The story goes about as a journey starting from the first year to the fourth year and in this process, how life begins with ragging and the eventual attachment of friends, politics, student fights, emotions and hostel stories. The students come about with their share of picnics and how they help each other with their problems and lives. The day arrives when the exams begin and how each thinks of their career and future when the crucial time comes."
