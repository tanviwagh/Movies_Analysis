    "plot outline": "Vasan (Jai Akash) is the son of the psychiatrist Vaikam (Sarath Babu), who runs a mental hospital while Nisha (Nicole) is the daughter of the Defence Minister Alexander (Ashish Vidyarthi). Vasan is an avid fan of music but he pursues a MBBS course for fulfilling his father's wish. Before the graduation ceremony, Vasan shares with his friend (Karunas) the best moments he had during his college life. Last year, Nisha (Nicole) joined the medical college as a last year student. Vasan fell in love at first sight with his co-student Nisha and they even became friends. Nisha eventually fell in love with him but they couldn't express their love. At the graduation ceremony, Vasan and Nisha received gold medals from the hands of their fathers but they still cannot declare their love. One day, goons try to kidnap Nisha and her father saves her but, in the process, Nisha suffers a head injury. She is admitted to Vaikam's hospital as a mental patient. Vaikam suggests her father that music therapy might cure her mental illness and Vasan cures her by singing a song. Alexander is grateful to them so he is ready to give them anything in return for saving his daughter. Vasan and his parents then make a marriage proposal and Vasan tells Alexander that he was in love with Nisha.

Thereafter, Vasan kidnaps Nisha but Alexander uses his powers and they are caught: Nisha is locked in her bedroom while Vasan is held by police officers. Vasan manages to escape from the police and releases his lover Nisha. Goons who want to kidnap Nisha, Alexander's henchmen and police officers are in pursuit of the young lovers. Afterwards, Alexander changes his mind and approves for their love marriage.",
