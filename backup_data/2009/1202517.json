        "Mumbai-based Kedar Shukla is employed as a chauffeur with Anoop and Simone Mehta, and silently absorbs abuse heaped on him by the latter. He lives an impoverished lifestyle in a small room along with Yadav - a watchman; and Aman - a waiter. While Yadav has family in a village, and sends money regularly, he must come up with more as his son is ill. Aman is friendly with a Caucasian-Italian woman, Kate, and would like to marry her but she tells him that she desperately needs Rs.20,000/-. Kedar lends some money to Yadav but a pickpocket steals the money, leaving the latter depressed. In this state of mind, a male picks on him, Yadav knocks him down, and takes him home much to the chagrin of Kedar and Aman. Yadav offers to get rid of the male via Kedar's car but secretly negotiates a ransom deal with the male's family, and after obtaining the monies, shares it with his room-mates which they refuse to accept. They subsequently relent and decide to partner with Yadav by abducting middle-classed men, demanding a small ransom, and thus improving their lifestyle. Things do start to improve, Yadav gains confidence, while Aman saves enough money to lend to Kate - but the silent and brooding Kedar has secret plans of his own - plans that will shatter and change their lives forever.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)",
