The next day he wakes up with a hangover, unable to re-locate what happened the night before. Fearing that he might have been more than indiscreet, he discusses this in detail with Amit and Jaswinder - and slowly realizes that they were not the only ones who were aware that he was with Sophia - amongst the others who maybe aware could be his wife. More shocks and surprises await him when he decides to delve deeper and goes to meet with Sophia.",
