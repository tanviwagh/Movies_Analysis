    "plot outline": "Birth of a legend. Following King Richard's (Danny Huston's) death in France, archer Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe), along with Will Scarlet (Scott Grimes), Allan A'Dayle (Alan Doyle), and Little John (Kevin Durand), returns to England. They encounter the dying Sir Robert Loxley (Douglas Hodge), whose party was ambushed by treacherous Godfrey (Mark Strong), who hopes to facilitate a French invasion of England. Robin promises the dying knight he will return his sword to his father Sir Walter Loxley (Max von Sydow) in Nottingham. Here, Sir Walter encourages him to impersonate the dead man to prevent his land being confiscated by the crown, and he finds himself with Marion (Cate Blanchett), a ready-made wife. Hoping to stir baronial opposition to weak Prince John (Oscar Isaac) and allow an easy French take-over, Godfrey worms his way into the Prince's service as Earl Marshal of England and brutally invades towns under the pretext of collecting Royal taxes. Can Robin navigate the politics of barons, royals, traitors, and the French?",

Following King Richard's ('Danny Huston' (qv)'s) death in France, archer Robin Longstride ('Russell Crowe' (qv)), along with Will Scarlet (Scott Grimes), Allan A'Dayle (Alan Doyle), and Little John ('Kevin Durand' (qv)), returns to England. They encounter the dying Sir Robert Loxley ('Douglas Hodge' (qv)), whose party was ambushed by treacherous Godfrey ('Mark Strong' (qv)), who hopes to facilitate a French invasion of England. Robin promises the dying knight he will return his sword to his father Sir Walter Loxley ('Max von Sydow' (qv)) in Nottingham. Here, Sir Walter encourages him to impersonate the dead man to prevent his land being confiscated by the crown, and he finds himself with Marion ('Cate Blanchett' (qv)), a ready-made wife. Hoping to stir baronial opposition to weak Prince John ('Oscar Isaac' (qv)) and allow an easy French take-over, Godfrey worms his way into the Prince's service as Earl Marshal of England and brutally invades towns under the pretext of collecting Royal taxes. Can Robin navigate the politics of barons, royals, traitors, and the French?::don @ minifie-1",
        "England 1199. After the death of King Richard the Lionheart, archer Robin Longstride and his comrades--archers Allan A'Dayle, Will Scarlett, and soldier Little John--return to England. As Robin assumes the identity of the deceased knight, Sir Robert Loxley, he witnesses the coronation of cruel King John, who orders the collection of harsh new taxes, and heads to Nottingham. There, they meet Sir Walter, Loxley's elderly and blind father, and Loxley's widow, Lady Marian. Now, against the backdrop of deceit, incessant machinations, and the prospect of a French invasion, Robin embarks on a noble mission to avert the plans of sinister forces, unite England, and restore its glory. Can Robin and his loyal brothers-in-arms right the many wrongs in King John's kingdom?::Nick Riganas"

    "synopsis": "The film opens in the middle of the night as the Sherwood robbers run through the forest. The robbers run through Nottingham and put their horses into a stable. Lady Marion (Cate Blanchett), wife of Sir Robert Loxley, rouses her servants and demands that they open the gates. Taking an arrow and setting it aflame, she shoots it at the feet of one of the robbers and tells them that she can see them. After they leave, she realizes that the seeds and grain of Nottingham were stolen and that they won't have anything to plant come spring.Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) leads his men through the forest back to their own camp. When he fought in the Crusades, Robin was only an archer. As English troops lead an assault on a French stronghold, Robin and his men fight valiantly alongside King Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston). A young archer attempts to plant a bomb bag on the portcullis but gets stuck. Robin races to him and rescues him before the French can kill him. Robin then retreats to safety before igniting the gate.
