        "After a labour leader is framed by a mill-owner and publicly dishonoured, he leaves his wife and children to face the wrath of angry mill workers. His elder son is badly affected by the hard childhood, drops out of school and grows up to be a violent mafia don (Rajnikant). The younger son, sheltered by his brother and mother, goes through school and college and ends up with a job in the police force.::Joyojeet Pal"
