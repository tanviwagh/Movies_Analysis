    "plot outline": "Mere Khwabon Mein Jo Aaye is the story of Maya. Maya lives in New Delhi, is married to Vikram and has a daughter Priya. Maya's life is mundane and centres around her family. One evening she overhears a conversation between her husband and another woman and realises that he's having an affair. Her simple, family centric life around her breaks down and she realises how Vikram had slowly degenerated her confidence and self esteem in the past few years of their marriage. He stopped her from singing and abandoning all her dreams. During a conversation with her neighbour Mrs Mathur, who is looking for an ideal tenant, she conjures up her fantasy man, Jai. Through Jai, who keeps reoccurring in her dreams in different avtars, she regains her confidence. He inspires her to pursue her ultimate dream of singing. With the help of her neighbours, a young band, she embarks on realising her dreams. Will her fantasy turn into reality or will reality hinder her dreams?",
