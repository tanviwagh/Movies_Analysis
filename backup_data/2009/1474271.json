        "Quite fluent in English, Chandigarh-born Vir Pratap Singh re-locates to Mumbai, and works as a Sous-Chef with Leena Grand Hotel. He lives in Khar and is friendly with his neighbors, which include Sandhya Iyengar, who also works in the same hotel as a Receptionist; Parminder Kaur - who likes Italian food; schoolgirl Deepti J. Mehta - who has a crush on him; and his maidservant, Shanta Bhansode. In the hotel lobby, he woos bookshop manager, Sharmishta Basu; attempts to strike a friendship with leggy model Susan Raj; and befriends and beds businesswoman Nafisa Khan with hopes of getting her to invest in his dream of running his own restaurant. He permits each woman to think that they know him well and lets them guess his Sun Sign. When he feels the time is right, he decides to make his move of using one of the women for fulfilling his dream - little realizing the shocks and disappointments that await him.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
