He is friendly with Bonny and Hitchcock, has a crush on 22-year old Mitika, and wishes that he was older so that he could woo and marry her. Hitchcock takes him to a wishing well, asks him to make a wish, and shortly thereafter Mickey turns into a six-foot tall 22-year old male. He leaves home hurriedly, moves in with Bonny, gets hired by Tiku Malhotra, acquaints himself with Mitika and both fall in love with each other. Complications arise when his distraught parents face bankruptcy, while his wish is on the verge of expiry - reverting him back to being a 12-year old again - with no chance of ever getting married to his sweetheart.",
