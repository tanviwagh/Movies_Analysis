    "plot outline": "The movie tells the story of Sam, a successful neurosurgeon, who leads a contented life with his wife Devi, a reporter for a Tamil-language magazine. The entry of old and new friends wreaks havoc with Sam's emotions, causing ripples of doubt and mistrust. In the meantime, Devi finds friendship elsewhere, leaving Sam to wallow in his own despair. Amidst all this turmoil, Sam tries to hold on to his marriage and cling to his rational side. As the suspense heightens and the movie reaches its climax, Sam is unsure whom to trust, and you yourself will be looking for the truth behind every phrase and every corner. Little do Sam - and you - know of the dangers that lie ahead... Will ever-rational Sam stay focused and true to himself? Will the doubts overwhelm him? Will his friends betray him?",
