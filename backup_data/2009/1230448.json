    "synopsis": "A remake of the hugely successful Malayalam film Kadha Parayumbol, Billu (formerly \"Billu Barber\") is the story of a small town man, Billu (Irrfan Khan) who mentions to his family that he was once a friend of superstar; Sahir Khan (Shahrukh Khan). Sahir Khan happens to come to the village to shoot a film and Billu's children spread the rumor that their father is his childhood friend. The villagers, on hearing their Billu could be their ticket to meeting the star, shower him with gifts and promises on condition Billu make contact for them. Billu is embarrassed by his poverty and doesn't want to impose, but everyone works themselves up so he's forced to make several ill-fated attempts at contacting the star while he's shooting just outside the village. But it's the school principal who, after threatening to expel Billu's children for non-payment of fees, has a turnaround when she believes Billu is able to get the star to appear at a school function and speak to the children. She goes to Sahir herself and requests his presence at the function for the children. Were Billu and Sahir childhood friends? Will Sahir meet with the villagers?"
