        "Marriage is supposed to be made in heaven. But, for three friends -- Meet, Amar and Prem -- it has become hell on earth. For Meet, whose name means \"lover\" in Hindi, marriage has crimped his \"cool stud\" lifestyle. His wife Aanchal makes sure he cools his heels at home. Prem's parents forced him to marry Geeta, a sweet, innocent and \"my husband-is-my-god\" kind of woman. She would rather press his feet than \"you know what.\" Amar is terrified of his wife Bindiya and her equally domineering mother, who lives with them. When these three buddies meet up after three years, their frustrations with marriage fuel their conversation. They decide the only way to spice up their lives is have as many affairs as possible for the next month. Then, they'll regroup and exchange notes. So, the rollicking process starts as the three men go looking for \"biryaani.\" With Inspector Sikander hot on their trial, they find themselves in one crazy situation after another as the film races to its hilarious climax.::Sujit R. Varma",
        "Meet three married men, Prem, Meet and Amar, who have been married for a few years, but already have the \"seven year itch\". They decide to be bachelors for a few days, and take advantage of their new-found freedom by flirting and having affairs with attractive young women. They do find three women, one who turns to be a transvestite; the second who wants to take photos of naked men for a commercial; and the third lifeless = dead. Before the hapless trio can stock of what has happened, they find themselves as prime suspects by a very suspicious Police Inspector Sikander, who has taken a personal dislike to them, and wants them to be in his custody, so he can work them over, in return for a confession; and of a black-mailer who has some very revealing photographs, for which he wants a hefty sum - a sum the trio can only obtain by stealing.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
