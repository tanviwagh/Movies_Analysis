        "Over the years the friendship of Usman and Pandit has flourished, despite of their different religion and cultural backgrounds. Their children have now grown and are of marriageable age. While attending the marriage of Usman's daughter, Arjun meets with Khusboo and falls in love with her. They meet after the marriage, and Khusboo too feels attracted to Arjun. Arjun is unable to bring this matter up before his parents and Usman for fear of being rejected as he is not a Muslim. He, however, confides in his paternal uncle, Raj Narain. Raj Narain agrees to approach Usman on this behalf, but dies tragically. Now Arjun thinks that his love affair is jinxed, and is unable to talk to anyone about this. Khusboo is relying on Arjun to make the next move, but when he doesn't, she agrees to marry the man of her parents' choice, leaving Arjun even more depressed and alone.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
