He meets with lovely Bindu (Saira Banu) and falls head in love with her. Coincidentally, Bindu moves in next to his house. Bhola is thrilled, but soon despairs when he learns that Bindu has given her heart to Master Pillai (Mehmood). Bhola's friends Vidyapathi (Kishore Kumar), Banarasi (Mukri), and others belonging to an acting troupe, assist in hoodwinking Bindu to get attracted to Bhola, and thereby getting his love life back, but there are unexpected twists and turns, and Bhola's lies are exposed, making Bindu return to her plans to marry Master Pillai.
