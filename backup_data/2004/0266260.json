        "_Arjun_ (qv) Malvankar after his graduation thrives to get job. The corruption and injustice taking place in his community frustrates him to the extent of revolting with the help of some of his friends. This path of his gets him into serious problems with the law and some outrageous gangsters. He is then taken in by a politician named Shivkumar Chowgule; who not only has pity on him but offers him a job and encourages him.

        "Mr. Malwankar lives a small tenement in Grant Road, Bombay, with his son, _Arjun_ (qv), daughter, Sudha, and wife, Rukmini, who is his second wife, as his first wife perished. Although he is well past his retirement age, he continues to work for an abusive employer, Ashok. _Arjun_ (qv)'s attempts at seeking employment are all in vain. One day when hoodlums are beating up a man, he intervenes, beats the hoodlums up with the help of half of his friends. This is when his life changes forever. One of his friends', Mohan, is killed; _Arjun_ (qv) finds out who the killers are, and kills them in broad daylight; he is arrested, and subsequently released, only to be told by his father that he is no longer welcome. A politician, Shiv Kumar Chougule, takes a liking to _Arjun_ (qv) and employs him, and gives him all the support and assistance he needs to fight hoodlums. _Arjun_ (qv) now finds he has a mission in life, and is quite content. He meets with Geeta Sahani, and they both fall in love. Then there is a change in the political set-up, which results in Shiv Kumar compromises with the very powers he had undertaken to destroy. Now _Arjun_ (qv) has no one to stand behind him and support him, and he may have to take up his fight against Shiv Kumar, or die trying.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
