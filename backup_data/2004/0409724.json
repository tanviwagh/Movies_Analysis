Anuj apologizes, but soon thereafter is in trouble again - this time attempting to steal and leak examination papers from his college. The College Principal, out of empathy for Aditya, does not press criminal charges against Anuj, but decides to rusticate him from college until and unless he provides the names of his friends who were also involved in this theft. Anuj refuses to do, quarrels with Aditya and runs away from home. A few days later, Aditya identifies Anuj's body in the morgue - he had been shot and killed by the police for drug trafficking. Aditya is devastated by his death, and does not believe his brother was capable of handling drugs. Together with his former lawyer girlfriend, Payal,he attempts to find out what made Anuj a drug trafficker.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
