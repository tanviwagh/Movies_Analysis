        "Parsimonious Indian multi-millionaire is exasperated at his spendthrift wife, and a klutz-like son. In anger he asks his son, Harish, to leave his house and try to find a living on his own. When he finds out that his wife, Kokila, has been squandering his hard-earned money on tons of jewelery, he angrily snatches one of the expensive necklaces, and tosses it out of the window. Then the hapless Hasmukh is subjected to uncontrollable changes in his life, as he tries to avoid a bankruptcy, an affair with a much younger woman who is also having an affair with Harish, an impending divorce, and loss of confidence by the business community.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
