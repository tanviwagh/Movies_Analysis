        "Crime and corruptions take its toll on Mumbai, India; with politicians, Influential businessmen and gangsters putting pressure on the crime branch police officers headed by DCP Hari Om Patnaik and his crew consisting of senior inspector Vikram Singh, Sub-inspector Appa Kadam Naik and Havaldar Khaled Ansari. The only problem is the police are unable to incarcerate anyone as there are insufficient evidences.::gavin (racktoo@hotmail.com)",
        "DCP Hari Om Patnaik is assigned to a police station, and is shocked to find that rules, and regulations, and the very reason for joining the police force, have been thrown to the wind. His colleagues, Inspector Vikram singh, Appa Kadam Naik, and Havaldar Khaled Ansari, have accepted the easy way of life which is to leave the big-wigs alone, but go after their henchmen, and arrange \"encounters\" with them, as well as take and split bribes (haftas) to augment their meagre earnings. Hari Om attempts to change this, and ends up having Havaldar Khaled killed at the hands of henchmen, who he himself had ordered to be released. Now he must content with the rest of the staff at the police station, his seniors, the general public, as well as the criminal dons, who can now carry now, while the police fight their very own politics.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)",
        "Honest, diligent and brave DCP Hari Om Patnaik has to bring to charge some dangerous criminals, however to this extent he is successful in doing so and is promoted to Bombay's crime branch where senior police inspector Vikram Singh and his crew which includes Inspector Appa Kadam Naik, head constable Khaled Ansari among others has control. On arrival he finds that these cops are not discharging there duties properly and attempts to bring them to justice. It takes the help of Vikram Singh along with the help of the entire police department to bring some of Bombay's big criminal wings to justice.::gavin (gunmasterM@hotmail.com)"
