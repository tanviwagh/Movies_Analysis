        "Ranbir Sehgal and Ria had been in love, but their love did not last long, mainly due to Ria's mental illness. Ria was confined to a mental institute, and Ranbir marries Dr. Anjali, a psychiatrist. The Sehgals give birth to a baby boy, who tragically dies. Then years later Ria enters Ranbir's life, and tells him that she has given birth to a son named Varun, and would like Ranbir to accompany her to meet him. Ranbir is delighted and anxious to meet his son, and agrees to go with Ria. After Ria and Ranbir drive for several days, Ranbir starts to realize that Ria is more intent on the journey than on the destination, and that Varun may just be someone she conjured in her mind.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
