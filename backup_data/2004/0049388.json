        "A terrified wife tries to escape from her insanely jealous husband who is bent on killing her.",
        "Her new husband's behaviour convinces _Julie_ (qv) Benton that his jealousy is dangerous, and when he admits he killed her first husband she realises she has to get away. A long-time friend helps all he can, but even in a town the size of San Francisco, Benton seems able to track them down. The police can do nothing despite a death threat, so the next move is up to _Julie_ (qv).::Jeremy Perkins {J-26}",
        "Living in Carmel, California, _Julie_ (qv) and Lyle Benton, a flight attendant and a concert pianist respectively, are having problems in their marriage because of Lyle's extreme jealousy. A recent incident consisted of his jealousy resulting in a violent outrage followed by what to her seemed like a heartfelt apology and pleading to her to help him get over this jealous feeling. This marriage is _Julie_ (qv)'s second, her first ending when _Julie_ (qv)'s then husband, Bob, committed suicide. When Bob's cousin, Cliff Henderson, suspects that Bob didn't commit suicide, _Julie_ (qv) thinks that Lyle may have murdered him instead. Upon questioning by _Julie_ (qv), Lyle does admit to killing Bob, all in the name of his love for her. With only Cliff to help her, _Julie_ (qv), knowing that Lyle will kill her as well if she ever tries to leave him, has to come up with a plan to get away from Lyle for good. When _Julie_ (qv) is called in unexpectedly to work on a flight, she might have gotten her opportunity to get away. But even if she can get away, she will have to convince others that Lyle is a murderer, with no direct evidence as such except her word against his.::Huggo"
