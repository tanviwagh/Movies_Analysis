        "When the Indian president, Veer Pratap Singh, and his daughter, Kinjal are abducted and held as hostages in Switzerland by the Pakistani terrorist gang the government of India decides to summon, Captain Aditya Arya from the army and send him on a secret mission namely to rescue the president and his daughter. The same gang is using a dancer/singer, Alisha as a fore-front for smuggling illegal drugs thus when her friend, Shilpa finds out she is cold-bloodily murdered with the body being taken away in the trunk of a car. Upon arrival in Switzerland, Aditya meets up with an Indian Secret Agent, Atul Bhatnagar and Alisha; together the three team up to strive for the impossible in a foreign land with little resources, and no support from the Swiss nor the Indians.::gavin (racktoo@hotmail.com)",
        "The Indian army is aware of Pakistan's ISI and Al Qaeda's Pushtoon speaking agents having a meeting in Switzerland. They find out that these two groups may have abducted the Indian President, Veer Pratap Singh, and his daughter, Kinjal, and are holding them hostage. Captain Aditya Arya is assigned the task of rescuing the President and his daughter, in complete secrecy, as to do otherwise may jeopardize the life of Mr. Singh, and cast aspersions against Switzerland. Upon arrival in Switzerland, Aditya is met with Atul Bhatnagar, another Indian Secret Agent, and a beautiful singer/dancer, Alisha, who claims that she has seen her colleague murdered and the body taken in the trunk of a car. Together these three set out to try and do the impossible - try and rescue a President - in a foreign land, without any communication or support from either the Swiss or the Indians - not knowing that they themselves are being ensnared in a web of deception and lies.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
