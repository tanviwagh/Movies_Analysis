        "Diya Malhotra lives with her dad on a farmhouse. She is friendly with Arjun Khanna, but thinks he is something of a jerk. She goes to spend some time with Raj Chauhan at his orphanage, and finds that Arjun will also be spending some time there. Raj has an ulterior motive to invite both of them, as he plans to get them to fall in love, and hopefully get married. But this does not happen, and Raj invites Ishaan, who, after Diya's approval, readily agrees to marry Diya. The wedding date is set, and Arjun is heartbroken, as he finds that he really loves Diya, but realizes that it is now too late to declare his love.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
