Aryan is the epitome of all the values that Ria's father abhors - wild, unpredictable, overpowering and obsessive. But he has all the qualities that Ria had always wished her life partner should have, an intriguing, magnetic and sensitive personality. Aryan has only one mission in life - being in love with Ria. Nothing else matters. Soon begins a war of ideologies, desires and wits. How far can Dr. Malhotra go to convince his only child that she's headed towards disaster?::Annonymous",
