        "A united household is shaken to the core when Raju's (Salman Khan's) brother-in-law marries a prostitute.",
        "Pooja comes from a very poor family consists of her mom, dad Ramlal, and brother, Raju. She meets wealthy Thakur Suraj Pratap and they fall in love and marry with the blessings of her family and relocate to the Thakur family mansion with Raju. Pooja finds that she's unable to conceive. Raju falls in love with the Thakurs' daughter Jyoti and is all set to make her his bride, to which Thakurs agree but tragedy strikes when the Thakur meets Vaishali, whom he wants to make his bride and nobody dares oppose his decision, including Pooja. Raju solely protests, but is silenced by the Thakur, publicly humiliated, and shunned by all the family, including Jyoti. Now his dream of marrying Jyoti will never come true and he dare not oppose the Thakur's words, lest he be responsible for his own sister's ruin.::raj (krazymonster@ymail.com)",
        "Pooja and her brother Raju share such an inseparable bond that when she marries multi-millionaire Thakur Suraj Pratap, she asks him to accept her brother; he agrees and Raju moves into the couple's bungalow. Soon Raju and Pooja are introduced to the Thakur sister Jyoti and in order to raise Jyoti and Raju the couple decides not to have children. Time passes and eventually a grown-up Jyoti and Raju fall in love with each other and hope to marry. Meanwhile Thakur is ensnared by prostitute Vaishali; when Raju notices this, he does his best to prevent Pooja's home from breaking up but instead the Thakur publicly humiliates him, disowns him, and throws him out of their home. On another occasion Raju's attempts fail forcing the Thakur to threaten to divorce Pooja over Vaishali. Eventually Vaishali's true colors come to light, forcing the Thakur to disregard Vaishali, only to find his life threatened.::gavin (racktoo@hotmail.com)",
        "Prosperous and aristocratic Thakur Suraj Pratap sees a young woman performing pooja at a temple, and instantly falls in love with her. He finds out that the woman's name is Pooja and she belongs to a poor family consisting of her mother, dad Ramlal, and brother Raju. He approaches Ramlal for Pooja's hand, and Ramlal is delighted to accept him as his son-in-law; the couple are married with pomp and ceremony. Pooja is very fond of Raju and takes him along to the Thakur's palatial home where Raju meets Pratap's sister Jyoti. Years later, Raju has grown up, Pooja has been unable to have children, and Raju and Jyoti have fallen in love. One day Suraj meets Vaishali, a stunning courtesan, and decides to make her his mistress. He disregards any advice against this decision, and even casts Raju away and cautions him from having to do anything with Jyoti or his household. He even threatens to divorce Pooja over Vaishali. Unable to bear the shock, Ramlal passes away. Raju's attempts to convince Suraj to let go of Vaishali are all in vain, as Suraj openly weds Vaishali and asks Pooja to accept this decision or else leave his house. Pooja must now decide to stay with Suraj or leave him with his new wife.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
