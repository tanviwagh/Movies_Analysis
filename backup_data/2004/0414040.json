        "Vishnu Prasad Singh lives with his parents and is employed as a salesman; he is always ignored and demean by other people due to the old-fashion way he dresses and his attitude of keeping to himself - while at home his mother leave no stone upturn in nagging and physically abusing him while in the neighborhood the boys teases him. The only bright spot in Vishnu's life is his next door neighbor, Mohini the girl he love with all his heart but unfortunately she give her heart to U.S. return, Sameer while Vishnu continues to stay in his dream world by admiring her on the sly. To worsen matter on one occasion Sameer physically assault Vishnu; fed up of life Vishnu plead with the almighty to make him invisible and to his shock the next moment his wish comes through. Not so happy with being invisible at first Vishnu starts to rue over destiny until he find the right use of it by attempting to make right for himself by physically harassing the people who used to taunt him while he was visible - his main targets are Sameer and his very own mother. His exercise gets out of control forcing the lawmen to intervene by creating a situation using Mohini as the medium so that they can easily shoot him.::gavin (racktoo@hotmail.com)",
        "Vishnu Prasad Singh lives a middle-class life with his dad, Balwant, and mom. He is generally ignored by his dad, pestered and abused by his mom. He works as a salesman, but due to his lack of confidence in himself, he is unable to accomplish much. To make matters worse, the boys in the neighborhood make fun of him all the time. This compounds his shyness and timidity all the more. The one bright spot in his life is a young woman named Mohini, who he is attracted to and keeps on staring at her on the sly. Then a young man named Sameer, from the U.S., enters Mohini's life, bursting yet another bubble in Vishnu's dreamworld. Fed-up, he prays with all his heart that since no one really notices him, he would be better off invisible - and his wish comes true. Alarmed at first, then delighted with his new powers and gift, he goes about trying to make things right for himself, and avenging himself against those who had wronged him, including his mom and Sameer. He gets so caught up in this that one thing leads to another, and soon he is living a life of crime. When the police find out that their culprit is invisible and has a crush on Mohini, they use her to entrap him. The question is does Mohini have any feelings for Vishnu or will she fully cooperate in entrapping Vishnu to the police - who have been ordered to shoot-to-kill.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
