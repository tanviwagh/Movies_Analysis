        "Isow Alex is a convict who has been awarded death sentence for murdering 7 people. But Alex has a wish to speak to Sethurama Iyer before his is hanged. He tells Sethurama Iyer that of the seven murders that were imposed upon him, one (which supplied the strongest evidence against him) was not committed by him and he wants Sethurama Iyer to find the murderer as his last wish. Sethurama Iyer then begins his investigation which ultimately leads to dark secrets that one would never have imagined.::Mohammed Afrin"
