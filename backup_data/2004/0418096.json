        "A tarot card reader Drishti, has an incredible ability to predict future with her cards and foresee certain incidents much before they actually happen. She is a widow with an 8-year-old son. Among Drishti's clients is Rhea, who is an abused wife seeking some help to find solution to her husband Sunny's violent behaviour. Drishti advises Rhea to leave her husband. Her advice only angers Rhea's husband and he threatens Drishti with dire consequences if she did not stop counselling his wife. Mohit is a car mechanic, who is emotionally inclined towards Drishti. He is a slightly eccentric man because of his troubled childhood. Rahul is the principal of a school and is engaged to a beautiful woman named Natasha. Natasha is a fast girl with a sensuous demeanour. She is committed to Rahul. But then, she is also spotted in the embrace of a young man named Abhigyan at a party. One night after a late party, Natasha goes missing. No one has any clue to where she is or what happened to her. Rahul seeks Drishti's help to find her. As the threads of many stories come together before Drishti, and as more blood is spilled, the face of the killer begins to come together gradually before her till the finale when the killer stands exposed.::gavin (gunmasterM@hotmail.com)"
