    "plot outline": "Anand Narayan comes from a poor family, which consists of his wife, Gayetri, daughter, Kamla, and two sons Madhu and Govind. Through hard work, Anand starts on his way to success. He meets with Nekiram, who becomes his business partner, and also his samdhi (in-law) as his daughter is in love with Madhu. Both get married in a simple ceremony. After this marriage, both Nekiram, and Anand and his family work hard at preparing food in a small dhaba, which soon grows into a restaurant, then a larger fancier restaurant, finally a five star hotel. Now Anand and his family are all wealthy and live in a palatial home. Anand gets to talking to Bhagwan Shri Kishan, who regularly visits him and asks about him and his family. Anand proudly takes all the credit, and asks Kishan to accompany him to see his success and his hotel. Bhagwan Kishan declines, but agrees do so later. Things don't go quite as well for Anand, when he finds out that Nekiram has been cheating him. Nekiram leaves the house, but Madhu accompanies him. Then Anand finds that Govind has been squandering money and time on women and alcohol; and to top his disappointment Kamla gets pregnant. When Bhagwan Kishan comes to visit Anand again, he admits that he is a failure, his health is poor, and his family are all strangers to him. Lord Kishan advises Anand that this is his life and he must learn from the Mahabharat, and that every life is a struggle, which is confused by relations and near and dear ones, and also by one's ego. Once the ego is removed, then only one can see clearly. But will Anand be able to understand and carry out what Lord Kishan is asking him to? Or will end up taking the blame, like he took the credit, upon himself?",
