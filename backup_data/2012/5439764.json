        "Married for five years and yet childless, middle-aged Vishwasrao is under pressure to perform, literally. Set in a remote Wada in Maharashtra, the film sees a very loving Vishwasrao being a good husband to Wife no.1, Prajakta (Nisha Parulekar). With a mother (Surekha Kudchi) who'd kill for honour, with a comical turn of events, Vishwasrao finds himself married to Wife no.2 Madhavi (Kranti Redkar). While Vishwasrao's hopes for a ''honeymoon'' takes flight, his two wives strike and a uncanny friendship that have him at his wits' end. Watch the film to know how all hell breaks loose with the entry of Wife no.3 Pari (Tejashree)."
