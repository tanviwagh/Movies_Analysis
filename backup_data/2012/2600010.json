        "We market our picture perfect, Facebook-savvy lives, as we navigate our fabulous body-doubles past other people's walls, collecting friends, being successful, living the life. Online, we are happy. Online rocks. It's Offline that sucks - as we shut our laptop, shut our _Bedroom_ (qv) door, rest our head on our pillow and sink into the familiar discomfort of being our unattractive, unaccomplished, pitiful selves. This is the allegorical \"_Bedroom_ (qv)\" -- our most private space where we retire to, night after night. Where we let our guards down and dare to be at our ugliest worst.::Anup Chakraborty"
