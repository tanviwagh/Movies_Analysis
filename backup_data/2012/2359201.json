One day, Saravanan sees Meera (Hansika) at a traffic signal and it is love at first sight for him. He desperately runs behind her to win over her heart. He even takes the help of his friend Partha. But all their plans fail. As it happens, it is a cat and mouse game between the two. But things take a turn and Meera's wedding gets fixed with an industrialist's son.",
