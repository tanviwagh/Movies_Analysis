    "synopsis": "The story begins with a pregnant woman, Vidya Bagchi (Vidya Balan), landing to Kolkata from London in search of her missing husband Arnav Bagchi. In her quest for her husband, she finds out that her husband's identity does not exist in the city. No records, either the flight's or the hotel's where her husband was supposedly staying or the company's where her husband had supposedly come for an assignment show any evidence that he actually exists. There is this docile police sub inspector (Parambrata Chatterjee) who is helping Vidya in her search. In the course of their search together, he develops some affection for her. The movie however does not have a romantic forte but this one-sided feeling of affection is very subtly and impressively captured in the movie.\nThe story gets more entangled and suspenseful when people involved in the interrogation get murdered and when the IB (Investigation Bureau) also seems very interested in this missing husband case. Why are they killed? What is the interest of the top officials in an ordinary pregnant woman's search? How is this related to the missing husband? All these answers are not revealed even until the end. The story has succeeded to grip the audience throughout. The presentation of real Kolkota is done very well. Good direction, good performances and once again a bravo job by Vidya Balan!"
