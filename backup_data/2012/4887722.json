    "plot outline": "Madhavankutty (Sreenivasan) is a school teacher in a small interior village where nothing much happens. The village is identity-less as the title suggests. So, when a theft happens in a moneylender's shop, everyone around is baffled. It gives sleepless nights to the panchayat president (Nedumudi Venu) and the police officer in charge of the area (Innocent). As they have no inkling about who the culprit may be, they device a plan to catch someone with a previous record. Madhavankutty is the sole eye witness as the shop is visible from the place where he lives. A major part of the story is devoted to showing how Madhavankutty dodges the pressure tactics of the police and counters their arguments. Parallel to this, we have the typical life and politics of a village: people discussing issues in the teashop, the ruling coalition bringing in modernisation by buying a coconut tree climbing machine that even women can use, the opposition taking out marches and walking out of panchayat meetings.",
