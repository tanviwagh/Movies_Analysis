    "plot outline": "Sandhyaa Arun(Kajal Aggarwal) is a student who is madly in love with Karthik (Ravi Teja), a techie based in Italy. She decides to travel with him to India, confident that the travel time would be enough for her to get Karthik to fall in love. Karthik reciprocates her gestures in a friendly way, but finally reveals that he is married to Vasudha (Richa Gangopadhyay) but is waiting to seek Divorce. Sandhya comes to know about Karthik's stint in Subramaniapuram as a football coach and about his affair with Vasudha and that he wants to divorce her because of Incompatibility. She also realizes that despite all that baggage, she still has feelings for Karthik. At this point, Karthik springs a surprise and reveals a shocking bit of information that he is not married and the story he narrated was his friend's and told it so that it should not repeat in their life as he loved her too. This infuriates her to the core and leaves him breaking in tears. Into this comes in Gautham (Nara Rohith), who is Sandhya's brother in law and madly in love with her. Based on her Mother's (Jayasudha) suggestion, she agrees to marry Gautham. Gautham observes that she still loves Karthik and goes to talk with him. After a conversation, he comes to know the Sincerity in Karthik's love, he lets Sandhya realize it and lets her go to him on their Engagement Day. But all goes vain as Sandhya knows that Karthik left to Ooty leaving her. Finally she too goes to Ooty after 3 months and reunites with him.",
