Except that he is a 45-year old Parsi bachelor still living with his overbearing mother and grandmother. But it's not like he's stopped trying. Desperate to get him married, Farhad's mother drags him to see women and even to embarrassing Parsi matrimony services. In the midst of all the daily humdrum, Farhad meets the woman of his dreams: Shirin Fugawala ('Farah Khan'), who drops by his store. Shirin, who works at the Parsi Trust, hits it off with Farhad from the start. Everything seems to be perfect and Farhad gets ready to introduce Shirin to his mother. But mummy becomes the villain in their story when she discovers that Shirin is the devious Parsi Trust Secretary who got the illegal water tank in their home demolished. The water tank being the 'aakhri nishaani' of Farhad's late father doesn't help matters. The ups and downs in Shirin-Farhad's relationship and how the two try to make it work is the rest of the journey.",
