In India, these 3 factors play a huge role in how society judges an individual.English Vinglish is the story of a woman who does not know English and is made to feel insecure by her family and society at large. The film is a light - hearted yet touching and transformational journey of Shashi.

The film is shot mostly in New York and captures the inherent struggle of many people all over the world with the English Language. Hilarious, touching, sensitive, and this film marks the comeback of India's biggest female star...Sridevi."
