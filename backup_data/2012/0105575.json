        "The urbane son of a village chieftain struggles between his personal aspirations and those of his family.",
        "Set against the backdrop of the feudal Madurai district, controlled by big landlords who employ their own gangs and often indulge in expensive feuds with their neighbours.

        "The London-educated Shakti (Kamal Haasan), son of an village chieftain Peria-thevar (Shivaji) returns home after a long stay abroad. Accompanying Shakti is his girlfriend (Gautami), with who he intends to settle in a city and start a business. However, his father hopes he will don the patriarchal mantle, a role Shakti finds alien and distasteful after several years abroad. Then, an accidental conflagration and its consequences turns a new set of responsibilities on Shakti... Good performance by Nasser as the evil cousin. The film was remade as Virasat in Hindi.::Joyojeet Pal"
