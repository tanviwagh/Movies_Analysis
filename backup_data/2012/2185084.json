She embarks upon her maiden expedition to Sydney leaving her protective shell and family behind. Coming from a conservative middle class background, life and culture in Sydney was an instant eye opener for her. Under guidance of her caring cousin Kalpana fondly called \"Kol\", Meghaa slowly embraces her new life in Sydney where she makes new set of friends, which includes cherubic Lubaina, prankster Raj, and narcissistic Suhail. Love and romance was something that was strictly not in her agenda of things. However being young at heart it was just something waiting to happen to her when she met Rohit - a charismatic, full of sheen and friendly natured fellow student in the University with whom she starts gelling right from the word go. What happens thereafter is something to watch out in this fun, quirky, emotional and furiously endearing love story set across two hemispheres in the entertainment extravaganza called \"From Sydney with Love\".",
