        "The movie is loosely based on Agaths Christie's The ABC Murders, where the murderer signs off as ABC (like how he signs off as Z in this movie) in his letter to the detective Hercule Poirot. There is some loose similarity in the killings, as well as the alphabetical names of the victims. That is not to take away the fact that the movie has been well done.::TeshNair"
