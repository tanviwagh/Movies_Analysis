        "Omi Khurana (Kunal Kapoor) returns from London in debt after going missing for a decade from his loving paternal grandfather's (Daar ji- Vinod Nagpal) ancestral home in Punjab. His return delights his paternal aunt Lata ( Seema Kaushal ) & his cousin Jeet, but is viewed correctly with quiet suspicion by his Father's younger brother, his perceptive & dignified uncle Hemraj ( Rajendra Sethi ). Another person perturbed with Omi's return is his childhood sweetheart, Harman ( Huma Qureshi ) who is a local physician now- but at heart,is still the unpolished,delinquent school girl who's cut out of the same cloth as the shady Omi. While Omi is blase about how he left Harman, she is secretly still in love with him- an affection she is wary of & tries to curb at first with her assessment of Omi's true character & the bad influence he wielded on her in their school days. While Omi lies about being a rich Ferrari driving lawyer who lives near the Buckingham palace (a lie readily accepted by his aunt Lata & Jeet & Lata's eccentric brother, Titu - but not his Uncle Hemraj) he conceals from his family that he's really there to rob them again to erase his debt to London gangster Shanty. Harman's brother Lovely, who runs a store selling underwear & is trying to become a real estate agent & move up in life, brings Omi an offer of Rs.one crore from funny,dhaba owning rival,Kehar Singh for Daar ji's famous dhaba & the recipe for Daar ji's secret 'chicken Khurana'. Omi is stumped since the recipe is known only to Daar ji,who is old,adorable & recognizes no one but a crow- whom Daar ji believes ,is the love of his life, his beautiful, dead wife Muskaan (Omi's grandmother) & keeps singing to the scruffy black crow besides absent-mindedly & hilariously,responding in 'dhaba style' to people,\"tandoori or makhani?','curry or sukka' etc. Other memorable characters are Daar ji's cousin,'bua ji', a pot-smoking God woman; Dalidri, the loving man-servant who considers himself a family member; Titu Mamaji, the eccentric scooter-riding uncle who sleeps on the terrace, carries a radio,wears an undershirt everywhere,complains about his sister Lata's bad cooking & is suspicious of Jeet's sexual orientation / potency; Manty , Shanty's delightful gun-wielding enforcer who follows Omi to Punjab & gets hilariously gets homesick for his 'pind' & his 'bebe'.::C J",
        "On-the-run from the London mafia, Omi returns to his ancestral village - a place he'd flown from with his granddad's money and grander 'London Dreams'. Will Omi be able to hide his failures while chasing love, and the lost recipe of the infamous dish, 'Chicken Khurana'?"
