Their ambitious plan comes to a screeching halt when one of them has a change of heart and their lives take an eventful turn. Is this the beginning of their transformation? Will they still complete the heinous crime which brought them to Mumbai? Or will they just become victims of fate and their sinister ambitions? Stuck in the quagmire of greed, politics and conspiracy, what does the fate has in store for these four guys?",
