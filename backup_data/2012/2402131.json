    "synopsis": "Shooted in Delhi Kismet Love Paisa Dilli (KLPD) is a one night story of Lokesh (Vivek Oberoi) and Lovina (Mallika Sherawat). Lokesh is a college going middle class guy and Lovina is the girl next door, who miss their last metro back home and a series of on the edge moments occur through the night where Lokesh and Lovina run across Delhi in night from cold streets to glitzy farm house parties all...to gradually fall in love. Also some trouble also occurs due to a sinster Minister who wants his video tape back as it consists his sting operation. Also there is also a great suspense at the climax of the film. The consists of full-on comedy dialogues and all the actors performed brilliantly. Dialogues have good punch which creats good comedy as well as some are rhyming too.\nIt has good Haryanvi accent in dialogues which is usually seen in Delhi people.\nCharacters such as \"Nunnu\", \"Kaptaan Saab\"(Ashutosh Rana) , \"Lokesh\", Gay Fashion Designer were awesome and were also very funny.\nThe film consist of clever and funny humour with good music.\nThe location i.e Delhi is being propely presented.\nTherefore the conclusion which I come at after watching KLPD is \"Its full-on madness with a message of corruption in Delhi\".Though the film didn't worked well at Box- Office, its only because I think that there is misunderstanding between Vivek Oberoi and Salman Khan so.... this awesome film was not let go to its level through politics in industry."
