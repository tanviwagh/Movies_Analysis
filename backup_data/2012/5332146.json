He has his own recipe for enjoying life-marry a working woman who will feed him all his life. He lives with his mother, elder brother and sister, and is called Boss by everyone at home. He spends most of his time in his friend Sundar's hair-cutting salon and blows away much of Sundar's money on booze. He meets Chandrika on a bus and falls in love with her and she takes a secret liking to him. He wants to marry her, but when he approaches her family with his proposal, they make fun of his jobless existence. This angers him and forces him to start a tutorial for Class X students after taking a loan from a local money lender. Bhaskar makes a good profit from his tutorials, but Chandrika's father, who is a bank manager, still disapproves of the match.",
