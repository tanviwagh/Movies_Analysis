        "Just as the police believe they have eradicated mafia rule from Mumbai, a ruthless man named Surya arrives in the city to revive mafia rule. He starts by turning his Dharavi-based friend into his assistant, and helps a local politician get rid of a witness to his crimes. His first brawl with police officers brings him face-to-face with commissioner Ajay Bhardwaj, whose daughter Chitra has fallen for Surya. Having kept an eye on Surya, Ajay gets him arrested after a shootout, exposing his real identity before Chitra. However, as Surya gets released, he strengthens his position as a vigilante with rivals thirsty for his blood."
