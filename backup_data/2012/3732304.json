    "plot outline": "POWER CUT - A high voltage Comedy by Jaspal Bhatti When you give a pen in Jaspal Bhatti's hand, he will churn out a story that is going to be different stuff. If by chance you assign him to misdirect the movie you are sure to go mad laughing in the theatre. Those who have fake dentures are advised to keep them in their pockets or else they may lose them while laughing laud in the darkness of the cinema halls. It is basically a youngsters' movie. Two young boys and a beautiful young girl named 'Bijli' in an electrifying love story. The film is backed up by a strong team of A-class comedians who tackle the issue of Power Shortage. Jaspal Bhatti's previous film was 'Mahaul Theek Hai', it was a super hit and a trendsetter. Mahaul Theek Hai did 25 weeks in Amritsar and 11 weeks in Chandigarh. Till today no film has broken that record. Jaspal Bhatti's made a Video Film, 'Jija Ji' that again was a super success. Jaspal Bhatti's earlier works like Ulta Pulta, Flop show and Full tension have become classics in the history of Indian Television. Jaspal Bhatti always comes up with a new idea. THIS TIME IT IS POWER CUT - a satire by Jaspal Bhatti.",
