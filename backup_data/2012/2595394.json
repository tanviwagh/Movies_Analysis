Further, she told that Bapi is not manly enough and lacks any mystery in his life. Another day Bapi's sister-in-law found adult magazines and evidence of masturbation, asks Bapi's elder brother to get Bapi married. Bapi went to see his prospective bride, where he meets Sheuli, a middle class girl. Sheuli asked Bapi, if he loves someone else. He confessed that he loves Dola.
