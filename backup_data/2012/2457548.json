    "plot outline": "The film tells the story of Shantanu (Dileep), a researcher in Linguistics, and his two friends, Kalpana (Samvritha) and Anuradha (Mamta). Anuradha is the sensitive type who has gone through certain bitter experiences in her teenage, where her cousin approached her with love, which she later realized that it was just his lust for her. Kalpana is slightly capricious and loves being in love. Anuradha wants to play Cupid and bring Shantanu and Kalpana together; she knows that they care a lot for each other, but for some reason or the other are hesitant to take the next step. Kalpana's parents are against her marrying Santanu and they try to bring proposals from their own (Brahmin) community. At one point Kalpana's aunt tricks her into meeting a guy, Sanjay, who they hope Kalpana will like and get married to. While they travel with Sanjay in his car, they meet with an accident, which causes some scars on Kalpana's face and gave her a disfigured toe. After the accident Kalpana backs out from the relationship with Santanu and give-in to her parents' wishes to marry Sanjay. Anuradha feels very bad for Santanu and tries to console him. It is then that Santhanu realizes that Kalpana had actually not loved him at all. Though his actual love was near him, so close, he failed to recognized it.",
