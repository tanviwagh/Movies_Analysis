    "synopsis": "Koi Jaane Naa is an edge of the seat roller coaster noir\nnarrative in the whodunit genre which turns a quaint little\nhill station into a dark world where death leaps out from the\nimaginative mind of a sleazy crime thriller novelist and come\nalive into the real world. The film revolves around Kabir who\nis a very successful author struggling with a severe case of\nwriter's block compounded by the guilt of ghost writing cheap\nbestselling pulp fiction. He meets Suhana a damsel in distress\nwho is a free spirit but struggles with her own nightmares, on\nthe run from her own demons. They find comfort in each other\nand spend time together in the quaint hill station. Kabir\nfinds inspiration in Suhana's innocence and acceptance of him\nfor who he really is and she in turn finds a friend in Kabir,\nwho is compassionate and understanding, someone she\ndesperately needs.\nA simmering romance is in the offing but things turn on their head\nwhen a relentless blackmailer is found dead in the\nquaint little hill station after a public spat with the author\nKabir. A series of baffling murders soon follow and Kabir is\nin the dock.\nThe story now takes the audience on a thrilling ride as the\nneedle of suspicion shifts from the obvious to the probable\nand from the possible to the maybe, never allowing the\naudience to ever come within a mile of the climatic unravel.\nThe center piece of this narrative is the ghost writer Kabir\nand the beautiful and innocent Suhana. They both get sucked\ninto a world that seems for more dangerous than the world that\nhad been created by the ghost writer Kabir in his raunchy\nHindi novels. But this heady mix of intense twists and turns\nand chilling murders seem pale when Zaraan Khan the vigilante\ncharacter created by Kabir in his sleazy novels makes his\nappearance in a human form baffling everyone involved and\nblowing every possible theory up in the air and in the process\ncreating a whodunit that leaves the audience enthralled.\nWhen Suhana sees Zaraan Khan kill someone she can't believe\nher own eyes. She is sucked into the dark and disturbing\nworld but Kabir's love helps her come out triumphs on the back\nof some of his own uncommon wisdom and survival instincts."
