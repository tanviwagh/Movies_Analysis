He's the only witness, and he aims to keep it that way. It should have been David Marx in flat 311. The hit-and-run driver who killed his father. Frank wasn't looking for vengeance; only justice. Now he'll find neither. Somehow, an innocent man has been killed. A man Frank has never met and has no connection with, but who is more dangerous dead than he ever was alive.",
