        "A story about unrequitted love - the shapes it takes, the ways it change us and the exhilarating and often heartbreaking role it take us on.

        "Shiv and Bani are college students and the former is a badminton player who wishes to excel in the sport, even though his father would like him to get a job and help with their dire financial situation. Bani helps Shiv understand that instead of getting a low-level job now, he can study hard and make something of his life. She also teaches him the meaning of friendship. Shiv falls in love with her but despite his dedication to her, she decides not to go against her family and gets married to Kaabil. Shiv, meanwhile, continues to pine for her. A few years later, an unexpected turn of events reunites the duo."
