Karthik travels to Madurai looking to make a film based on the life and times of the notorious rowdy Assault Sethu (Bobby Simha). He teams up with his old friend Oorni (Karunakaran) and the duo tries to dig up enough backgrounder for their film. They get help from Kannama (Lakshmi Menon), the daughter of the women who makes idly's for Sethu! However mid-way through their script research, they experience an unexpected twist and realizes they have caught a tiger by its tail.::Sethu"
