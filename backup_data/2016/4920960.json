        "On a public election holiday, five friends meet in a resort deep in the jungles to spend a day drinking and merrymaking. They come from different backgrounds and professions, but they have only one aim - to enjoy life for one day far from the hassles. But, during the course of the day, the animal instincts within them come to the fore. To resolve the crisis and to end the boredom, they decide to play a game - a game played when they were kids."
