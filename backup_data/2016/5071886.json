        "The _Kabali_ (qv) movie deals with the plight of migrant Indian community, specifically the Tamilians, who lived in Malaysia. About 30 years back in time, many of the Indian laborers working in Malaysia, used to work as drug traffickers and goons under Chinese mafia gangs. One man, Kabaleeswaran alias _Kabali_ (qv) (Rajanikanth), takes a stand for the betterment of his community. Himself a gang member working under gangster Sitaramaraj (Naazar), _Kabali_ (qv) takes over the gang leadership on Sitaramaraj's untimely death. With the gang leadership, also come the rival gang confrontations especially with Gang43 lead by the ruthless drug lord Tony Woo (Winston Chao). In his position as a gang leader _Kabali_ (qv) also aids his community. He founded the Free Life Foundation, a non-profit organization to help poor uneducated Indian laborers in Malaysia. However, the violence of heading a gang takes its toll on _Kabali_ (qv)'s family life, weaving into the movie a family element with the pursuit of _Kabali_ (qv)'s wife. The rest of the movie comprises of _Kabali_ (qv) and Gang43 trying to overpower each other.::Sanjay Kumar V N"
