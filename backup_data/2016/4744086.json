Arjun Kapoor is a rich son and so is Kareena Kapoor who is a very successful marketing executive well supported her boss- as shown in the movie. The two meet in a typical Bollywood style and after several outings in Rail museum and restaurants, decide to get married albeit without much fanfare through a registered marriage. The story then follows the swap of roles of husband managing the household while supporting a spouse's career. While Kareena succeeds in her career and is overshadowed by Arjun's out of turn popularity whilst endorsing several brands, giving talk shows etc leading to differences between the two and thus an ego tussle. The tussle is resolved with the matter convinced by two super ladies- Swaroop Sampath and Jaya Bachan and the movie ends on a happy note. Star guest Amitabh Bachan adds glitter to the script too. Arjun is passionate about trains and is off to National Rail Museum with Kareena for datings. He also has an exclusive toy rail set-up in his room and kitchen. His passion for trains is even picturised even in one of the songs. The other passion for him is cooking-both for his family and later develops that as a profession. Cooking is shown extensively whilst endorsing several cooking based brands aligned to Kareena's marketing ventures.",
