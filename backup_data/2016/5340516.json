        "Sannasi & Sooravali belong to a group of people from Padithuraiin Thanjavur who make a living by practicing the folk art of 'Karagattam'. While Sooravali is head over heels in love with Sannasi he doesn't openly reciprocate her feelings but still loves her from within. However, when a young government employee approaches them with a proposal asking for Sooravali's hand a chain of events are set in motion that has disastrous consequences.::PipingHotViews"
