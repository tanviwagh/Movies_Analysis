    "plot outline": "Bombay-based Rajesh lives a fairly wealthy lifestyle with his parents, mom - a housewife and dad - a rather parsimonious businessman, named Amirchand. One day while walking on the beach, he comes across a beautiful blind girl named Shivani. He instantly falls in love with her. She also likes him, but understands that they cannot be married. Regardless of this, Rajesh asks his parents to permit him to marry her, to which his mother agrees, but his father refuses. Then Mr. Rai, Amirchand's friend, intervenes, he offers to pay for getting Shivani's eyes tested, and if she succeeds in getting her sight, then and only then can Amirchand permit his son to marry her. An eye specialist is consulted, who concludes that the only way Shivani can see is through the eyes of a dead donor. The question remains how long will it take for a donor to come forward, and if nothing happens, will Rajesh consent to marry someone of his father's choice?",
