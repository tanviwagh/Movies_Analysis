        "Dilip Kumar (Mukesh) is a deputed as postmaster to a remote village, Mutharamkunnu. There he falls in love with Ammu (Lissy) who he woos by posing as a friend of Malayalam superstar Mammootty. Wooing her is only part of the game, since he must next deal with his wily rival Dev Anand (Sreenivasan) and Ammu's father (Venu) who is obsessed with wrestling, and insists on Dilip fighting one of his star wrestlers as a qualifier to marrying his daughter. Enjoyable and well-paced, with its share of hilarious moments, this is one of Sreenivasan's early works.::Joyojeet Pal"
