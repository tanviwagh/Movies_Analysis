He marries her and returns to Bombay where he announces that he will never sing without Uma again. However, Subeer encourages Uma to sing alone and when her popularity is soon greater than his own, the seed of jealousy begins to grow... The major difference between Uma and Subeer is that she sings for herself, whereas he sings for the public. It is the difference between geet and sangeet. This is the root of the thing that later causes problems, and based on which the movie is named.",

        "Bombay-based famous pop-singer, Subir Kumar, is thronged by female fans everywhere, some even proposing marriage. But Subir is not certain that marriage is for him, until he meets Uma, while on a visit to see his Durga Mausi. He and Uma are soon married. Upon his return to Bombay, he announces that Uma and he will sing songs together. Noted poet Brajeshwarlal cautions Subir against this, but Subir goes ahead anyway, and soon realizes that Uma has stolen his popularity, and is much more sought for than he himself.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
