He also has to assuage his prospective father-in-law Sundar, whose elder daughter Pushpa's jewels (given for safekeeping) have been taken away by creditors. As King aka Kashi, he is busy fighting a drug mafia run by Deena, his arch rival Perumal and their cronies, whose drug cache he has cleverly spirited away. Post-interval, both Ganeshas share screen space with the drug loot going from Kashi to Karthik and vice-versa.",
