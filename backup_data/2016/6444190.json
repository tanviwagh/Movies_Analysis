Her husband Kalu is a 'casanova' who cannot fend enough for their living. Careless and irresponsible by nature, he wiles away time in gambling, flirting, doing nothing at all. A foreign couple, Patrick and Maria, come to India, a town in Gujarat, Anand, whereby there's a clinic that specializes in artificial insemination treatment, giving hope and opportunity to childless couples through women opting for surrogacy. It's a two way arrangement where the couple gets a child and the woman gets thick amount of money. Rudi gets to know through a source about this option that can give new rays of hope to her child's future and secure a financial stability for her family. The events that ensue, sees Rudi in the hospital, while Kalu gets closer to Maria, a frivolous romance thrives at his end. The climax sees a whirlpool of emotions unroll, with the tragic death of Mithi, Rudi loses control of the situation, feeling totally devastated. How the couple gets together to start a new tomorrow, to begin life all over again, minus their daughter Mithi and their cherished desires that they had dreamt of, is very sensitively and delicately shown towards consummation. Captivating and promising, the story is bound to keep you on the edge and feel the finer nuances, thus connecting an emotional chord with the film and its distinct characters.",
