It has lofty ambitions of being a fantasy and a story with the underdog taking on an impossible task. Though the film provides some comical relief, it buckles under its own expectations. When his close friend dies in an accident (a convenient one at that), our hero has the moral obligation to find his family. Our hero goes to a remote place (people here speak every accent of Kannada possible) where two villages are divided by a 400-year-old rivalry and his friend's family is caught in the middle. He has to use his wit and intelligence (on the village lords) and charm (on the two girls) to solve this age-old problem over two and a half hours.",
