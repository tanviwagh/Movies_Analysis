He falls in love with Sweety (Nushrath Bharucha) on first sight but when she bashes a guy for wrongly interpreting her friendship as love, our hero decides to put 'Project Sweety' on hold. Meanwhile, Karthik's family plans to marry him to Shalu (Vishaka Singh) but the former tells about his so-called love story to the latter and she offers to help him out by telling her parents they need fifteen days to take a firm decision on wedding. During the process, Shalu and Karthik develop a liking for each other but suddenly Sweety too reciprocates his love to our hero. The rest of the story is all about whether Karthik marries Shalu or not.",
