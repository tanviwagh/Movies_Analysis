        "Prem has been married to simple-minded and trusting Pooja for several years. Unknown to Pooja, he has been having several affairs with numerous gorgeous women. He would also like his close friend, Kishen, to have some extra-marital affairs, but Kishen is loyal to his suspicious-minded wife, Kaajal, and wouldn't dream of betraying her in any way. Having failed to convince Kishen, Prem hires a prostitute by the name of Bobby to seduce Kishen and have an affair with him. When Kishen meets Bobby, he is instantly attracted to her and is more than willing to have an affair on the sly. But things go terribly wrong, and Kishen must enlist the help of his co-worker, Shekar alias Sunny, to help him out of this mess. Watch how Sunny, Kishen, and Prem, get trapped into a web of lies and deception, and how the hapless trio attempt to wriggle out of this hilarious mess, and how they attempt to convince their respective wives of their innocence.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
