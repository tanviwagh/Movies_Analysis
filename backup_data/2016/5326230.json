He fell in love with a huntress named Mathangi (Ramya Krishnan), married her and built her a bungalow near the forest. When Udayapandyan is defeated in a war, he takes shelter at Mathangi's bungalow and she vows to take care of the king. She sacrifices her life before the deity Bhadrakali, to save the life of King Udayapandyan. However, Mathangi's spirit continues to stay on and a yogi (Om Puri) performs certain rituals to rein in her spirit. When this myth continues, it affects the life of a well-known businessman Satyajith (Jayaram), who leads a happy life with his family.",
