        "The Film is set in Our Own Gujarat covering a Metro City and a Beautiful Village. It's a Story about four friends who are Unique in their own way and Represents Today's Generation which is Fast and Fun Loving. Either you would find your own self among the characters or you would surely know someone who does. Romeo (Tushar Sadhu) and Radhika (Vidhi Parikh) are best of Buddies but not sure that they love each other. The other two Characters are the ones who add fun n frolic and become the spice of the story. The sheer simplicity of their friendship would win your heart and make u think of the friends you would have made in college and all the craziness u enjoyed with friends. It all about how Fun, Humor, Love, friendship tends to make a Huge Change in this World. It's a Movie to be watched and admired."
