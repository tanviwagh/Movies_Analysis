Sannya is principled though. He believes in earning a living rather than taking to stealing and doesn't tolerate anyone exploiting him or his friends. One fine day, he comes across millionaire Shreyas Kale (Khapre), an arrogant and narcissistic businessman. While Sannya is just trying to sell garlands to him, Kale gets agitated and slaps Sannya. That slap and a drunk-driving incident, seals Kale's fate. Sannya blackmails his way into Kale's house and life. Surprisingly for him, he's accepted in the family by Kale's wife (Chitra) and he ends up uniting the family.",
