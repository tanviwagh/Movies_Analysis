        "Three cousins, Arjun, Divya and Kannan, relocate to Bangalore where they face challenges that transform their lives.",
        "The film is a remake of the Malayalam smash hit - Bangalore Days. It s the story of three cousins - Divya, Kuttan and Arjun, fulfill their childhood dreams of relocating to Bangalore. As they embrace the warmth of the city, they also face challenges that transform their lives.",
        "It is 'Bangalore Calling' for cousins Arjun, Divya & Kutty with which they feel they could realize their collective childhood idea of spending a few merry months in the city. The circumstances that take them to Bangalore form the center of why they can't do what they intend to do together. As one central knot is untied, the troubles that loomed large begin to give way one by one, leading them to rediscovering their own selves, adding more meaning to their already lively journeys of life.::PipingHotViews",
        "Arjun (Arya) is an aspiring bike racer, a rebel from a broken family with a not-so-good childhood. He is a school dropout and is not treated with respect by other family members except his two cousins - Divya (Sri Divya) and Kutty (Bobby Simha) with whom he is very close. Kannan aka Kutty(Bobby Simha) is a software engineer, who is bored of his techie life and is yearning to go back to his native to enjoy the pure air and home food. When Arjun and Kutty's cousin-sister Divya (Sri Divya) gets married to a Bangalore based corporate guy Prasad (Rana Dagubbati), all the three decide to relish their childhood dream in the Garden City.::Naveen"
