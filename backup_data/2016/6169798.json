        "Just like when a delicious food is cooked to perfection, making it very tasty to feast upon, every ingredient in _Rama Rama Re_ (qv) including the characters, their performances, and the making of the entire journey stands on top for an unmissable watch. The raw look and feel of the film is another impressive detailing by the maker. Further, it is not philosophical nor does it tries to teach anything but the essence is one which plays on the minds.::Sharath Kumar K",
        "It is a simple story of a convict on death row, who escapes from prison and accidentally ends up with a veteran who is called upon by the authorities to teach the process of hanging a convict to the new staff. Thereafter the director threads their journey together along with few more characters who make their way in and out of the two main characters, leaving an everlasting impression on both the minds..::Pradeep Kumar"
