    "plot outline": "The film begins with the groom Surya (Harish Uthaman) getting ready to marry Jothi (Nisha) and narrating a flashback. In a flashback, the young man Surya was a blue-collar worker in a metal workshop. His parents (K. K. P. Gopalakrishnan and Vasanthi) wanted him to get married, but Surya was quite shy by nature, had low self-esteem, and his only social life was when he met his five friends who were unlike him. Anbu (Benito Franklin), who owned a photo studio, was a married man and a womanizer. Velliangiri (Vetrivel) was a carefree young man working in a cotton factory. Varathan (Madhankumar) was a loan lender who liked watching adult films and spending time with prostitutes. Govindan (Govindan) was a middle-aged man who was an ardent fan of Kamal Haasan and desperately wanted to get married. Shanmugam (Shanmugam) was a wastrel who tried to woo a village girl. Anbu advised Surya to follow his methods of wooing, but it failed miserably. Surya then watched adult films in a cinema theatre and went to a brothel as Varathan did, but when a prostitute touched his hand, Surya ran away from the place. Surya's parents then found him a girl: Jothi, a beautiful young woman who studied computer science. However, Jothi did not want to marry Surya: she found him not-good-looking and not educated enough; above all else, she was afraid of him. Surya then tried to change his looks and behavior. The two eventually got engaged with the blessings of their family. Later, Surya, who became an overprotective fianc\u00e9, suspected her college mate Kishore (J. Durairaj) of wooing Jothi and beat him up. Surya then tried to keep Anbu from his fianc\u00e9, and one day revealed Anbu's seduction activities to his family, and the two got into a fight. Surya even suspected her uncle (Kovai Madhan) from Dubai of wooing Jothi. In the meantime, Jothi started to like Surya for being caring and protective. The day before the wedding, a tensed Surya beat up Jothi's uncle; thus, the wedding was cancelled and her father Chellamuthu (Chellamuthu) wanted Jothi to marry her uncle. Surya and his family returned home. A saddened Surya drank poison. Shortly after, he came to know that his wedding was not cancelled and then fainted. Surya was rushed to the hospital and died in the hospital bed. Back to the present, Surya's body is buried in a cemetery and it was his spirit who narrated the flashback, while Jothi mourns the loss of her fianc\u00e9 at his grave.",
