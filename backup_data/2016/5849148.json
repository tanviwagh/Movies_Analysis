        "Dhayalan & Singaperumal both work as Engineers in Neyveli Lignite Corporation. Dhayalan wishes to nurture and encourage his son Vetrieswaran's skills and talents meanwhile Singaperumal makes his son Chakravarthy Singaperumal only focus on his school studies and nothing else. Mayil, Nandhini & Bhanu are friends with both of them. All of them sit for their 10th std exam in which Chakravarthy and Bhanu rank as State toppers. Singaperumal admits his son in a Residential School where they focus mainly on academics but Chakravarthy dislikes that School and he feels tortured. Vetri and his friends then hatch a plan to meet him in his hostel where visiting permission is denied bluntly. They then smuggle Chakravarthy out of his hostel to show him a good day out filled with fun and excitement. The Hostel warden punishes him severely for his actions and he dies as a result. The school authorities cover up the whole incident. Dhayalan exposes the school by lodging an official police complaint. However, Singaperumal loses his son merely due to the pressures of obtaining a perfect education."
