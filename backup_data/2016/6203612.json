It follows a safe storyline -- boy meets girl story, and with a little help from friends and a loving family, the two end up together. All a steady march towards a happy ending. Though it is a tried and tested template, this still makes for a one-time watch because Yash keeps the show going. The title character Santhu is a carefree youngster, who believes in being straight forward and his parents are proud of their son's open nature. Enter Ananya (Radhika Pandit) an architecture student and it is love at first sight for Santhu. But his dreams suffer a crushing blow when he gets to know Ananya is engaged to Deva (Shyaam) a builder and her maternal uncle. The rest of the story is whether Santhu plans to propose to Ananya and how he wins her over.",
