        "A director-producer tussle keeps a film in the cans long enough for it to consume the director's senses creating havoc in his family life.

Do they even realize that?.::PipingHotViews [Sivaram]",

Arul is a struggling director who becomes an alcoholic due to a fall out with his producer. This causes conflicts between him and his wife. Jagan is a college student who frequently gets into fights and displays strong feminist views when drunk. He smuggles priceless statues every now and then, along with Micheal. Micheal, who was in a physical relationship gets married to another woman from an orthodox background. Micheal and his wife face conflicts due to his 'nosy' involvement in the brothers' problems. The plot unfolds as Arul's wife demands divorce, Micheal's wife becomes pregnant, and Jagan leads Micheal and a few others through another smuggling so as to obtain enough money to release Arul's film..::Elka"
