A corporate guy (Kabir) with the connections in the government tries to occupy the acres of land. A court gives one month time to the trust to prove that the lands belong to the royal family or it would go to the corporate guy. He comes to Hyderabad searching for the members of Royal family. In Hyderabad, we meet a taxi-driver Balu (Sai Dharam Tej) and his father (Rajendra Prasad) who are leading a modest life in a middle-class house. Balu's father turns alcoholic as he lost all his money long back. Balu loses his heart to Bellam Sridevi (Raashi Khanna) who gets job of SI as her family bribed the upper officers. While he is trying to win her love, he meets a young kid Rajan who has no father and mother. On the other hand, the corporate guy sends some rowdies to finish off the heir apparent of the royal family. How Balu and the kid Rajan are dragged in this battle forms the story.",
