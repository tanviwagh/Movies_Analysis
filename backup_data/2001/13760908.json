    "plot outline": "A queen named Chitra is seen killing Amaravati, a peasant girl, so that her son, who was in love with her, cannot marry her. The queen did not approve the relationship, as the girl was poor and not of the same caste as the boy. The queen wants to get her son married to her niece. The niece helps the queen in eliminating Amaravati. They both kill Amaravati right in front of the king (the queen's son). His hands are tied and he is unable to save the love of his life. The death of his soul mate affects him such an extent that he dies in the shock. After three hundred years the peasant girl, the king, the queen, and the niece are reborn. The peasant girl is reborn as Durga, the king as Rishi, and the niece as Madhumita. Now Rishi is an actor and Durga a village girl. Rishi is shooting in a village in which a scene reminds him of the incident three hundred back in which Amaravati was killed. He shakes that feeling away and completes his scene. But in that village lives Durga, the present-day Amaravati. Just one eye contact between them is enough to make them realize that they are drawn towards one another. But Rishi's mother and Madhu are once again ready to create havoc in their lives. But despite every odd Durga and Rishi's love story keep on blossoming.",
