        "Karan (Tushar Kapoor) will go all the way to rescue strangers, and help love-lorn friends, regardless of the consequences. He belongs to a band of struggling artistes. His dad, Krishna (Dalip Tahil) is always finding fault wuth him a devout and religious mom, Sushma (Himani Shivpuri); and a percocious sister Priya (Rinkie Khanna). One day Karan loses his heart to beautiful USA returned Pooja Saxena (Kareena Kapoor), and loses his boldness, and is unable to approach her and show his true feelings for her. They eventually come to know each other, and Pooja does seem impressed by Karan's bravery when he rescues a child, and also herself during a vehicle accident. Acting on the instructions of his overly protective and worldly-wise tau (paternal uncle) Balram Singh (Amrish Puri) Karan boldly writes a birthday card for Pooja's birthday with his blood, and hopes that this message will impress her. On the contrary it repulses her; Karan finds out that she actually loves another person in the USA; and that eventually she will be returning to the USA to complete her studies. And all this increases his insecurity and decreases his confidence in sharing his true feelings for her.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
