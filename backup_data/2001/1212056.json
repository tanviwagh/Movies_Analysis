    "plot outline": "Yogendra (Mohan Babu) is the son of Panduranga Rao (Vijayakumar), a High Court judge who got first rank in civil services examinations. Dunnapothula Janardhan Rao (Narra Venkateswara Rao), a politician, falsely implicates Yogi in a murder case to take revenge on Panduranga, who had earlier given a jail sentence to him in a corruption case. Panduranga gives the judgment to his Yogi by jailing him for six years. After six years, Janardhan dies on the day Yogi is released from jail. Dunnapothula Dharma Rao (Mukesh Rishi), Janardhan's son, visits the shores of Godavari River to leave the ashes. Yogi foils the rites by resisting, then Dharma challenges Yogi that he is going to mix his father's ashes in the Godavari before Yogi mixes the ashes of his father, who is still alive, one day. Meanwhile, Yogi falls in love with a beautiful girl Anuradha (Preeti Jhangiani), the strong-willed and independent-minded daughter of Kasi Visweswara Rao (Raghunatha Reddy), Dharma's henchman. Suddenly, there is an appearance of Thulasi (Seema), who claims to be Panduranga's daughter. Panduranga refuses the claim and banishes her. Forced by circumstances and at the instigation and help of Dharma, she comes out open with the parentage claim. Yogi thrashes the protesters, but upon knowing the truth from his uncle Gnaneswara Rao (Kota Srinivasa Rao), he accepts the task of her protection in the capacity as an elder brother. Yogi decides to marry Thulasi to his good friend (Brahmaji), and he also prods his father to acknowledge the parentage of Thulasi. Panduranga confesses to Thulasi. The next morning when Yogi returns home, Thulasi is found dead. Panduranga is accused of murdering her. However, the whole act was planned by Dharma. After killing Thulasi, he forced Satya Murthy (Suthi Velu), Panduranga's servant, to testify against Panduranga in court. In court, Jagan (Nagarjuna Akkineni), a close friend of Yogi and famous leading criminal lawyer, appears as the defense council by canceling",
