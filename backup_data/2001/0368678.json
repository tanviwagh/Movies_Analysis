        "A film about desire, which is blindness in itself. You'll be the guest in the house and life of the blind Bengali poet Sashi Bhusan Sanyal: sometime you can see his own mental eye images from memory, while at other times you follow the small events of his every day life, through the other characters who gravitate around him in contemporary Calcutta. But even small happenings in everyday life can be transmuted by the vision of Poetry in a wider and deeper meaning.::Sanatkumar Sharma aka DigIt <kumara@intercom.it>"
