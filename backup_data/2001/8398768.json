For _Dany_ (qv) is his \"ket\" his life, he would not, under any circumstances to lose him, and so he decided early to escape from prison.::Hugo Van Herpe",
        "Hardened, stupid widower criminal Daniel '_Dany_ (qv)' Versavel not only refuses to sign for his teen son Sullivan's legal emancipation, but escapes from prison by helicopter to retrieve his doted prince. While the nationally mobilized police mysteriously fails to catch the idiot despite acting as subtle as an earthquake with the boy's godfather as loyal cahoot, _Dany_ (qv) collects 'Sully' from his Vis\u00e9 school, even notifies there taking him to 'home education', for which purpose he starts dating potential stepmothers after even a harlot can't stay with him, but plastic surgery helps there. The bank politely laughs away his half page 'business plan' to make billions on credit card publicity, klutzy fences regret working with him to rob homes he copied the keys to posing as locksmith, the cash loot he kept in his rectum in prison is squandered as on a soccer player 'performing' at Sully's birthday party. When the police finally catches on, it's time to flee to Ivory Coast, surviving a car crash by miraculous luck.::KGF Vissers"
