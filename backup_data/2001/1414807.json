He is all set to expose the aspiring Chief Minister, Babanrao Patil, and present evidence to the Police and the Courts. His plans are disrupted when Gyaneshwari is abducted and held until he turns over all documents to Babanrao. Arvind refuses to budge, and this leads to discord in his marital life as Sujata wants her daughter back at any and all costs. Things get even more complicated after Arvind gets arrested for inciting riots against Babanrao, while Gyaneshwari is held by three cold-hearted men, Savle, Ajay, and Sindhu, who will receive instructions on the Visarjan day of Bhagwan Shri Ganesh, to kill their hostage.",
