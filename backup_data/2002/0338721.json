        "Jai alias Jimmy is the local underworld don, owing allegiance to his elder brother, the more influential and powerful, Raghavbhai. Jimmy hangs around with his childhood friend, Sameer Deshmukh. Unforunately, for Raghavbahi, Jimmy gets in the bad books of the other operating Dons, and he must decide if Jimmy gets to live or die, by the same rules governing other hoodlums, or make different rules because Jimmy is related to him. Jimmy trusts Raghavbhai completely, but sources close to him warn him against Sameer, who is not what he claims to be.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
