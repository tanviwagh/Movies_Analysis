Due to Ajay's hot temper, he gets in the bad books of notorious underworld Don, Bhai-Jaan, and is told that after the 30 days of Ramadan, is expected to meet his fate with a violent death. Fate also tricks Ajay into getting in the bad books of Mr. Verma. Since Sohail works on the security detail on the college campus, he busts some drug-traffickers, Munna and Chhotte, and gets on their hit-list. First Verma has him beaten up; then Munna and his associates take a turn at him; and then Chopra calls the cops against him, and he get another beating from them too, and is left virtually for dead on the outskirts of Bombay. But Ajay recovers, and swears that he will marry Ayesha in the next 24 hours or die.
