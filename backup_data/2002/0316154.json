        "Bureacracy, red tape, and corruption has become part of life in India, especially in Nagpur. Unable to pay bribes, some young people resort to violence, leading to riots and many deaths. Pressure is put on the police, who aggressively bring in suspects, even people who had nothing to do with the riots, thus angering the community at large even more. Relatives of victims from police brutality, and an unresponsive and unreachable government, creates armed rebels who call themselves Naxalites, and promise to bring upon swift justice to everyone. Living in one such community is Dr. Kanna, who is well educated and opposed to any rebel-like attacks. He loves Rupi, his childhood sweetheart. He has a militant brother, Ghisu. Dr. Kanna leaves this community, to upgrade his studies for several months. When he returns, nothing is the same anymore. His community lives in fear of both the police and the naxalites; his brother has now joined the naxalites, and his sweetheart is missing.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
