One day she and some friends decide to holiday at Mount Abu. Once there she meets with none other than Vishwas, who is their guide. Both fall in love. In the meantime, devious Bharoselal convinces Vikas that his son is still alive, and asks his nephew, Jai, to pose as Vishwas. Vikas accepts Jai as his son. Vishwas gets hired in the organization run by Vikas, and Vikas takes a liking to Vishwas. Bharoselal schemes with his partners to poison Vikas' mind against Vishwas, and they do succeed, by convincing Vikas that Vishwas is actually the son of one of the criminal associates. In the meantime, Mamta is planning the marriage of Vishwas with Priya, little knowing the opposition she will run into.",
