Javed meets an admirer, Archana Vithalrao Patkar, and soon both fall in love. The Patkar family have no qualms about Archana getting married to a Muslim, and as such both Archana and Javed approach the Registrar of Marriages, and are informed that they will be notified within one month.

Then Javed's destitute family visits Bombay, and Jas and the Patkars decide not to tell them about Javed's death. The Khans consist of Siddiqui, Akhtar, and Shabnam, who her Javed's dad, brother, and sister respectively. Jas meets them at the railway station and brings them over to his house, and tells them that Javed will be back soon.
