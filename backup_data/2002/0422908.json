        "A bachelor and a movie stuntman, Tamilian Pammal K Sambandham, reprimands his brother, Anand, for hastily getting married to Malathi. He finds out that Malathi is being instigated by her single, male-hating friend, Janaki, who instructs her not to get intimate with Anand. Sambandham and Janaki play with Anand and Malathi's lives consistently, to prove a point about their individual opinions, against the institute of marriage. The story takes a hilarious turn and only get worse after Pammal falls in love with Janaki. Will Janaki, who not only dislikes him but also his profession, look beyond her assumptions and reciprocate his feelings?::Shrinivas G. Kulkarni"
