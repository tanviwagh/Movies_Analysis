        "Dinanath Shastri is a bank manager for 17 years, and has never taken his family, (wife, and two sons), for a vacation. He decides to treat his family to a vacation in Panchwati, and books the bank's guest house for that purpose. During the last days at the bank, he turns down a loan application from Mr. Shrivastav, which causes a lot of anger. Ironically, the \"easily swayed\" care-taker at the guest house has already rented the guest house to Mr. Shrivastav and his family, (wife, a daughter and one son) for a \"fee\". At the arrival of the Shastri family at the guest house, Dinanath is enraged, and instead of returning to the city to file a formal complaint, decides to stay on and make the holiday of the Shrivastav a virtual nightmare. In the meantime, Shrivastav also finds out that it is the very same manager who had turned his loan application, and he too is determined to make their holiday miserable. Chaos and comedy result as the two families confront each other.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
