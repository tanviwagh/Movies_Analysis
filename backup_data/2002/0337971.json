        "Psychological Thriller starring Akshay Khanna, Ajay Devgn and Urmila Matondkar. Ajay Devgn plays the antagonist and a person with split personality disorder. Akshay Khanna the criminal Lawyer. The main theme of the movie is based on 'Primal Fear' Starring Richard Gere and Edward Norton as the lawyer and the criminal respectively. Could have been a more crisp movie had the unnessary last 15 minutes been deleted. Excellent acting by Ajay Devgn and akshay Khanna saves the movie.::Subid Mitra",
