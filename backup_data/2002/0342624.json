        "Police Inspector Suraj is an orphan who was rejected by his biological mother, for reason(s) unknown. Suraj has grown up questioning how any mother could reject her own child. He meets with Raja, and after a few misunderstandings, they becomes friends. Raja introduces him to his mom Savitri, who welcomes and accepts him. Suraj loves Sapna and hopes to marry her someday. Unfortunately, Raja also loves Sapna; when Suraj finds out, he backs off and turns to alcohol. When Savitri's mom meets prominent politician, Yuvraj, she recognizes him as a wanted criminal, Thakur, but Yuvraj denies being or even knowing Thakur. This leads Suraj to wonder what prompted Savitri to point a finger at Yuvraj. His investigation will lead him to his birth mother, as well as his biological father, and he will come to know why his mother rejected him.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
