    "synopsis": "Sapna is the solitary daughter of a rich hidden world Don, Pratap Dholakia. She lives in fear of her dad and brother Raman's oppression, viciousness, and risky pack affiliations. Because of their various adversaries, they have kept Sapna bound at home for her entire life with just her sister-in-law, Nisha, for company and comfort. Profoundly shielded, credulous, and forlorn, Sapna wants to leave the house.One night, Sapna goes to her childhood friend's wedding without her dad's consent, and on the ride back home she is assaulted by Pratap's opponent pack. Rohit, a nearby undergrad, witnesses the assault and secures Sapna. They promptly experience passionate feelings for one another, yet before they can present themselves she is protected by Pratap's men. Furious, Pratap declines Sapna from going out ever again.The following morning, Rohit gets Sapna's name from a newspaper article about the episode. He and his companions figure out how to enter her home as a melodic band, performing for the Navaratri dance festivities. Sparkles fly among him and Sapna over the nine evenings of Navaratri and they begin meeting subtly. In spite of the fact that Raman is dubious, Rohit charms Pratap and gains his trust when Sapna clarifies that he was the person who had saved her the night of the group assault. Rohit sneaks Sapna out for trips in and out of town and takes her home to meet his folks, who get her affectionately. Nisha finds their relationship, cautioning Sapna of Pratap's savagery and what he and Raman would do to Rohit if they came to know. Meanwhile, Pratap, feeling that Sapna would be most secure abroad, orchestrates her to wed the child of a well off companion who lives in London. He declares their engagement on the last night of Navaratri before all visitors, stunning both Sapna and Rohit.One night, Sapna has a nightmare when Rohit embraces her, and then they get caught by Pratap and Raman's men, who capture Sonia and shoot Rohit. Subsequently, Sapna wakes up after a nightmare and ends her relationship with Rohit to save him from her dad and brother. Nisha subtly visits Rohit at his hostel to explain that Sapna loves him so much that she wants to see him safe. Nisha tells him that Sapna wants to save him by separating from him, and she tells him to leave Sapna and forget about her. Resolute, the evening of Sapna's commitment party, Rohit whisks her away to his lodging, thinking that it would be the last place Pratap would look for her. With the assistance of his companions (and, soon, all the young men in the school), Sapna is disguised as a male student and gets comfortable joyfully, tasting the opportunity unexpectedly. In the interim, Pratap accepts that Sapna has been snatched by his opponent, Kania Pathan, and Raman executes a savage quest for her, cruelly assaulting Kania Pathan's men and region. At the point when this demonstrates worthless, Pratap has his phone charge checked and sees constant calls to and from a new telephone number, which turns out to be Rohit's.Raman and his men show up at Rohit's lodging, proposing to recover Sapna forcibly. In safeguard, a hundred of Rohit's friends show up conveying sticks and bats, indicating fortitude with Rohit and Sapna. Before a battle can follow, Pratap shows up and openly yells at Raman for going to the lodging without his consent. He genuinely shows paternal concern, announcing his approval of Rohit and Sapna's relationship and persuading Sapna to get back with him to plan for her wedding to Rohit.Overflowing with bliss, Sapna shows up back home and tells Nisha of her dad's acknowledgment. However, Nisha says that Pratap tricked Sapna to try not to make a scene at the hostel and that her dad's pride is more significant to him than Sapna's satisfaction. Upset, Sapna begs Pratap, who irately tells her that she must travel to London that very night. Under the pretense of harmony, Pratap brings Rohit to his factory, revealing his actual goals. Pratap tells Rohit that he will only be safe if he forgets Sapna. However, Rohit says he will not forget Sapna, Pratap orders Raman and his men to kill Rohit. They fiercely beat Rohit and throw him in a gully, and they leave assuming he is dead. Sapna overhears what Pratap said about Rohit's death and overdoses on pills, expecting to murder herself. She leaves a suicide note in her room and, prior to leaving for the airport, she tells her dad that he has ruined her so much that she wishes to be with her dead mother. After Sapna leaves, Nisha discovers her suicide note and tosses it at Pratap, shouting at him for wrongly ruining his own daughter's life. Pratap then regrets what he has done to his daughter.As Raman and his men escort Sapna to the airport, Rohit shows up, bloodied and infuriated. With recharged strength, he fights them off while Sapna coughs blood. She is about to succumb to her overdose when he maintains his love for her and gets her to a medical clinic, where she is treated and stabilized and still alive. The film concludes with Pratap, enthusiastic and humbled, quietly embracing Rohit for saving Sapna's life again and officially giving the couple his approval for their marriage."
