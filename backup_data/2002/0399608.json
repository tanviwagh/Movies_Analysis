        "Beautiful Annu was waiting at Ooty Railway Station to receive her cousin, Shraddha Sharan, when a male comes towards her with a bouquet of flowers, and complimented her. He later apologized, for the flowers were meant for her cousin - but for Annu this was love at first sight. She did get to meet this male, Pratik Krathikeya, an Architect in New Zealand, who wants to marry Shraddha much to the chagrin of the the Sharan family who want her to get married to a male of their choice. Despite this opposition, Shraddha and Pratik got married, re-locate to New Zealand, and become parents of a son, Lucky. A few years later Shraddha passes away after an auto accident, leaving Pratik and Lucky devastated. Then Pratik gets an invitation from the Sharan family to attend a marriage ceremony. He, Lucky, his sister and brother-in-law, all journey to India - where they get an ice cold reception from the Sharan family. Annu is now a doctor in a local hospital and has a boyfriend named Karan. When Annu finds out that Pratik is in town - she is thrilled and excited - not knowing that he has an agenda of his own - and the impact her feelings for him will have on Karan.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
