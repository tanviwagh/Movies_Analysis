His dad is a reputable teacher in the village, however, has to surrender credibility owing to his young son's endless debts. The son decides to kill himself after taking a huge insurance that would pave way for the debts after his death. Although, he does not die. Instead, he is picked up by a fisherman and his owner via a fishing net. The fisherman along with his employer hospitalizes the son. But, when the son wakes up, he overhears the fisherman and the owner debating how much to ask as a remuneration from his family for saving his life. so, he pretends to be a mute.\nThe story takes a twist when the boat owner surrenders the fisherman and the mute at his moneylender's house, who are Punjabis.

It is followed by twists where the son reclaims his voice, falls in love with the deaf dame of the Punjabi house. Although his father and mother come to know about their son's resurrection, they withdraw from his life. However, his promised-girl (in Kerala Hindus, there is a tradition of marrying your aunt's son) or childhood sweetheart is seen wearing a white sari ( like a widow), living her days in mourning. The story follows another twist when they all reach the Punjabi house to confront the young man.\nHowever, everyone surrenders to the love of the Punjabi girl. The son gets married to the Punjabi girl he was courting and everyone celebrates."
