        "U.S. based Anjali Thapar (Amrita Rao) has repeated dreams of a parallel life in India, the temple of Devi Maa Durga, & some sword-weilding men on horseback. She and her mom consult a pandit, and he advises them to go to India to clear this matter up, as this pertain to her past life. Mr. Thapar will only let Anjali go there, after she marries the man of his choice, so Anjali decides to run away. Her dad alerts her uncle, a ruthless CBI Officer Sikander Baksh (Danny Denzongpa), who is soon on her case. Anjali meets with car-thieves, Karan and his uncle (Arya Babbar and Shakti Kapoor respectively), and then begins her journey into a past life, as Nandini, the lover of freedom fighter Abhay (also Arya Babbar), and his subsequent death at the hands of British-aided traitor Tejeshwar Singh (Ashutosh Rana). Anjali does not know that Tejeshwar is still alive, is a powerful minister in the Indian Government, and has decided that he will make history repeat itself by separating the two lovers again - this time with the help of the government machinery.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
