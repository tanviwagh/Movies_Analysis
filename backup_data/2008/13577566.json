    "plot outline": "The film begins with a dead body of cinema director Subbu (Thalaivasal Vijay) being found lying in a suitcase under a bridge. The tough police inspector Venkat (Bose Venkat) is assigned to unravel the mystery behind the death. Venkat first interrogates advocate Valli (Padma Narayanan) for killing him. She confesses him that she had found Subbu's dead body in her kitchen yesterday night and put him in a suitcase. She blames her archenemy P. T. Arun (Krishna), a film producer, for murdering him. P. T. Arun then confesses that he and his assistant Kannan (Swaminathan) attempted to kill Valli by poisoning her milk, but failed. According to the forensic report, the fingerprints of the three suspects didn't match with the fingerprints taken on the body. Venkat then arrests a funeral dancer (Manimaran) who had a fight with Subbu in a public place and a dumb pickpocket (Chengalpattu Maaran) but soon, he realises that they are innocents. His investigation leads to Subbu's wife Mohini (Sona Heiden), and she reveals him everything. Subbu was a lofty film director who struggled to deliver a hit film, he was known for being short-tempered and getting into trouble easily. With his entire focus centred on his profession, he failed to take care of his sexually frustrated wife Mohini. When the college student Vinoth (Ashish) entered into his house for the stay, Sona and Vinoth became closer thus having an illegal affair. When Subbu came to know about the affair, he was devastated and stepped out of the house. Later, an eye witness admits that he has seen Subbu having a fight with Nizam Ali (Sanjith) the night of the murder. When the police chase him, Nizam Ali dies in a motorbike accident. The lack of further clues means that the murder investigation came to a dead end and the murder case remains unsolved.",
