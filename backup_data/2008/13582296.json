Rubesh then interviews a college professor (Pandu) and he told him about an incident that happened a few months ago. Chandru (Vishwa) fell in love at first sight with Thulasi (Hasini).

Meanwhile, Pulipandi (Madhan), Arumugam and Mohan formed a small gang: they eve teased the college girls, ragged the boys and smoked ganja in the college. Afterwards, the straightforward Thulasi quarrelled with the three men for not respecting the college rules. One day, they eve teased Thulasi and she made them arrest by the police. Rubesh now knows that Pulipandi is the next victim but Thulasi kills him too. Rubesh finally arrests Thulasi for killing three persons. In court, Thulasi confesses that she was the murderer and didn't feel guilty of killing them. A few months ago, when Thulasi came to know about Chandru's lies, she first felt revolted but then, Thulasi forgave him. They were eventually engaged and the day before their wedding, Thulasi was abducted by the three men and they brutally raped her. A physically and mentally weakened Thulasi returned the next day, but Chandru refused to marry her because she lost her virginity and was \"impure\" for him. Following this incident, her parents committed suicide. Thulasi decided to use her body as a weapon: she seduced the three men and had sex with them to gain their confidence. A vengeful Thulasi killed them cruelly and cut their private parts in due course. Thulasi then abducted Chandru and as he humiliated her for losing her virginity, she raped the virgin Chandru. In court, Thulasi mourns that the women are ill-treated by society for being raped and the judge sentences her to the death penalty.",
