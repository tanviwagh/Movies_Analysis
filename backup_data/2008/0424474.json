The two men show educational films to disinterested villagers, while Paresh idolizes the image of a beautiful woman who appears in a surviving fragment of film. On the road, they encounter the pregnant Amina, who is attempting to reach an unspecified border to start a new life with her child. The trio forges an unlikely traveling alliance, just as they are also met with a series of setbacks: their 16mm projector is stolen, and Amina does not possess the documents which will allow her safe passage.",
