The film has Shreyas playing Shankar, a Mumbai cook. In desperate need of money, Shankar steals from the local Don named Khan (Naseerudin Shah). Giving the Dons croonies a slip, he escapes his way into a team of Doctors heading for relief work to Bangkok but loses the all important money bag into the chaos. In Bangkok his world turns upside down at a bar where he bumps into lovely Jasmine (Lena) who is a volunteer and a part time massage. The hitch is she is all Thai and he cant converse with her at all. A ray of home comes his way the next day when Jasmine turns up desperately in need of a Doctor.Shankar posing as an Doctor alongwith the goofy Sardar buddy Rachinder, jumps into this whirlpool while Jasmine soon gets pulled into his bumbling adventures while running away from the Don and his henchmen. Hot on their trail are the Dons rapper son Jamal Khan (Vijay Maurya) and his henchmen who have landed in Bangkok to retrieve their money.
