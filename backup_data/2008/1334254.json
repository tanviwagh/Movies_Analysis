        "After rescuing an impaired ex-film producer, Jaisingh Adenwalla (Naseerudin Shah), unemployed Subhash Sharma (Paresh Rawal) is hired as a Chauffeur much to the chagrin of the former's wife, Mallika (Neha Dhupia). Subhash again comes to Jaisingh's rescue when she refuses to hand him his inhaler, and is rewarded with a six-month salary in advance. Heavily in debt, addicted to alcohol, unable to handle the acrimonious relationship, and to teach his selfish wife a lesson, Jaisingh kills himself after challenging her to prove that his suicide is a murder in order to claim a Rs.24 Crore insurance policy. Malika decides to telephone the police but street-smart Subhash convinces her to partner with him in order to prove that her husband's death was a homicide, and then share the monies from the insurance claim.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
