        "_Kuselan_ (qv) revolves around the tale of a beautiful friendship between a popular actor and a poor barber.::Anonymous",
        "'_Kuselan_ (qv)' is inspired from the unconditional friendship between Lord Krishna, the wealthy king of Dwaraka, and his childhood friend, a man who lived in abject poverty with his large family. Their friendship stands as an archetype to the beauty of this unique relationship since time immemorial. This modern version revolves around a villager, who had shared a strong friendship with a popular cinema actor in his youth. However, due to their different careers they were forced to part ways, one becoming a national figure, the other, a village barber. Decades later, the actor returns to the village to participate in his film's shooting. Whilst the entire village become excited about the prospect of seeing the actor, the barber fears that his old friend would have forgotten him and would neglect him. However, when forced by the villagers to renew contact with his childhood friend, the question remains, will the supremely famous and wealthy actor embrace him? Will the humble barber and his family be rescued from abject poverty?::Santhosh"
