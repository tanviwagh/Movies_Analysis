    "plot outline": "Bharathi (Ramana) arrives in Munnar to work as an estate manager and his assistant Sanjini (Mansi Pritam), who is from Mumbai, helps in his job. One day, a labourer working in the estate dies of snakebite and they cannot save in time so Bharathi arranges a job interview to appoint medical staff. Bharathi then befriends with his assistant Sanjini and he thinks that she in love with him. Meanwhile, Bharathi receives anonymous love letters and an audio cassette of a woman singing. Later, Sanjini tells Bharathi that she considers him like a brother and she ties a rakhi around his wrist thus Bharathi symbolically becomes her brother. Bharathi slowly becomes obsessed with finding the woman who loves him. Roja (Swathi), a childlike woman full of joy, spends her time roaming with her friends and Bharathi begins to suspect her of being his secret lover. Roja reveals to Bharathi that she is in love with her relative Pulipandi (Ponnambalam), an ex-convict. Roja and Pulipandi then get married and they leave Munnar. When he returns home, Bharathi finds a letter telling him to come to an isolated place. Bharathi comes across a middle-aged woman (K. R. Savithri) and she tells him that she was the one who has written the letters. She also reveals that she is the mother of Devi and tells him everything. A few months ago, Devi (Akhila) attended the nurse interview and Bharathi who interviewed her praised her for her well-thought answers. Devi instantly fell in love with Bharathi. Devi was a young woman living with her parents and elder sister in the estate. She first told it to her family and they accepted for the marriage. One day, Devi had an epileptic seizure and was admitted to the hospital, the doctors revealed that there was no treatment to cure for epilepsy. Her father then died of a heart attack and her mother decided to support her love at any cost. Thereafter, Devi and her mother decided to meet Bharathi but during the drive, they had an accident and Devi was heavily wounded. Back to the present, Devi's mother begs him to forget her but Bharathi looks forward to finally see her. Bharathi goes to their place and finds Devi in a pitiful state: Devi has wounds all over her body and has developed an unusual behaviour. The film ends with a weeping Bharathi taking Devi with him.",
