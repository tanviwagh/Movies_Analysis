    "synopsis": "When first we meet veteran thespian Harish Mishra (Bachchan), he is\ngravely ill. The punishments of a film shoot have left the old man in a\ncoma. His co-star, Shabnam (Preity Zinta), is wracked with worry, but\ntheir director, Siddharth (Arjun Rampal), keeps strangely distant and\nrefuses to visit his ailing star. In flashbacks, their story emerges.Siddharth first had to woo Harish from the comforts of his retirement,\nand the interaction between the two yields some of the film's most\ndelightful scenes. The impatient young auteur attempts to win the trust\nand collaboration of the aged performer, who sits raging against the\nmodern world from the sanctuary of his study. Sporting a silver mane,\nBachchan is irresistible here - vain, forceful and impetuous. He\ntrumpets the superiority of Shakespeare over anything cinema can create.\nAnd yet, the movies hold out a new challenge.Once he agrees to act in the film, The Last Lear becomes a captivating\nreflection on the comparative artifices of stagecraft and cinema. As the\noutsider in the cast, Harish is hilarious in dismissing movie fakery.\nHis theatre skills are grander. Standing on a hillside, he teaches\nShabnam how to project her voice clear across a valley to the next hill. :)"
