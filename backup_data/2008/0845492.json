After the passing of her mother, she is consoled by a young man, Anthony Gonsalves, in the church graveyard. He introduces himself as the son of Jeffrey, who passed away during 1986, and works as a waiter in Jimmy's Pub, Bandra and wants to be a Bollywood actor. Thereafter she meets him again in the studios when he comes to audition for the part of Mark Anthony in a re-make of Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar'. Both are attracted to each other and continue to meet. Little does Riya know that Anthony has lied to her, as he never had a father by the name of Jeffrey, and the real person who brought him up is a gangster and killer, Sikander, who is now a suspect in the sudden disappearance of Police Inspector Gupta.",
