There he meets precocious and energetic Shenba (Kangana Ranaut), the daughter of the village chief. They fall in love and a marriage date is set. Meanwhile, he has to attend a medical conference in Moscow, Russia. Upon arrival, a beautiful blonde Anna (Mariya Kozhevnikova) drops her jacket which he retrieves, not knowing that she is smuggling drugs. She tracks him down to collect the goods, and he can't get rid of her because she doesn't speak Tamil and he doesn't speak Russian. The next morning he awakens to a police beating and blood everywhere, with a dead Anna next to him. With his lawyer Aarthi Chinappa (Lakshmi Rai) and embassy advocate Raghavan Nambiar (Jayaram) he has only a few days to find the real murderer, prove his innocence and return to marry Shenba."
