        "Wealthy Indrajit Gupta arranges his daughter, Rimli's, marriage with his employee, a Sales Executive, Ankur Sharma, who has been in his employ for four years. The duo get married and honeymoon in Kalimpong, Darjeeling. On the 10th day, just before returning home to Kolkata, Rimli reports her husband missing. Inspector Robin Dutt investigates, and is told that an unknown male has been stalking Rimli. Earlier during the day Ankur had an altercation with Mohinder Rai, a private taxi-driver. Unable to locate Ankur's whereabouts nor his body, the incident is closed, and subsequently Robin gets transferred to Kolkata. When he attempts to discuss this case, he is admonished by the Police Commissioner, and even Indrajit does not show any interest. Then on a rainy night, Robin discusses this mystery with four friends in their apartment - and each one comes up with a different conclusion as to what possibly could have happened to Ankur.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
