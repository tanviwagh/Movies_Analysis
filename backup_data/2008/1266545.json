Chandrama's only goal is to locate and kill Mahendra while Arjun wants to retire and re-locate to his home-town in Sultanpur. With increasing pressure of marriage from a pregnant Shubhi, Chandrama will find his life changing even more after Arjun gets killed by the police, and he is instructed that he cannot kill Mahendra - who is very influential - and is all set to become a Member of Parliament.",
