        "Dadar-based Kabir Achrekar lives with his parents and attempts to unsuccessfully obtain a degree in Engineering. Then one night while at Chhatrapati Shivaji Train Terminus he comes across an impaired woman and decides to assist her. He helps her board a Thane local, but she gets into fisticuffs with other passengers and they alight at Parel, where she passes out. He takes her to Hotel Godwin where he books a room for the night, and it is here that he gets arrested by the Police, held in a lock-up, as well in trouble with his mother, for not obeying her instructions to visit his Worli-based aunt, Sandhya. The next day is the beginning of one of many nightmares when he finds out that his cell-phone has been switched with the unknown woman, who contacts him, instructs him to meet her, and he agrees to do so. And it is this meeting that will change his life forever.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
