Meanwhile the media speculates on how he got away with stealing 140 TV sets, 212 Video cassette recorders, 475 shirts, 90 music systems, 50 jewelery boxes, 2 dogs, and a greeting card - in a spree of burglaries that included households in Bangalore, Chandigarh, Mumbai, and other cities in India.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
