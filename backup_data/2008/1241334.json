She is soon befriended by a kitty-party group consisting of Jasbeer Brar, Anita Jethmalani, Dilnavaz Noorani, Parimal Bhosle, Lata Kodialbal, and Sania Noorani, whose primary interest appears to be a daytime soap featuring modern characters of two lovers, Kunti and Arjun. Binita gets hired as a teacher, while Nitya gets a job at a call-center, MacMillan and Modi, through stock broker Feroz Sethna and Ritesh Jethmalani respectively. While Nitya gets attracted to Ritesh, she is a little dejected after she finds he has a steady girlfriend, Kirti Wagaskar. Binita is not concerned after being warned by Nitya that her new friends have been gossiping about her but will be displeased after she finds out they have been following her around to see if she is having an affair with Feroz. She confronts them and introduces them to Feroz, who ends up advising them about the Sensex and the stock market. The women enthusiastically start investing large amounts, appear on CNBC, and decide to increase their investments in Nitya's firm as they get a secret tip that Yash Modi is about to marry Divya Oberoi--resulting in an upward swing of shares. They will soon find out that all is not well when Kirti, who is about to be married to Ritesh, decides to elope with Yash.",
