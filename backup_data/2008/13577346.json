Raj first blackmails Nivetha to disclose about her love affair with Sakthi to her family and asks her money to buy his silence. With that money, he could pay the college fees of Sakthi. Raj then intercepts the audio cassette with the help of the police. Meanwhile, Nivetha accepts Sakthi's love. Later, Sakthi saves the three bad students who had stolen his money from being expelled from the college and they apologize for their mistakes.
