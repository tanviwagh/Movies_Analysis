    "plot outline": "The story revolves around a man (played by Dr. Raj) who grows up believing that women cannot be trusted, all due to his experiences of a troubled childhood after his parents' failed marriage and his father's suicide. The incident creates a deep wound in his mind and he suspects every woman he comes across to have a questionable character. This leads to him walking out of his marriage that was fixed with Malavika, who plays a double role for the first time in her career in this movie. Years later, they happen to meet each other and share their experiences in life. Malavika is now a Deputy Commissioner in the police force, and has a daughter (Malavika again) while Raj has become the Chief Secretary. Malavika wants to get to know Raj's family well and during her visit along with her daughter to Raj's house happens to see certain very disturbing and then highly confusing sights. She smells a rat and says so to Raj who blames all the bad occurrences on a ghost that supposedly haunts a bungalow that they lived in and how that ghost still continued to haunt that place terrifying people in its vicinity at very particular times every day. Being a police officer, Malavika is not fully convinced and wants to get to the bottom of the matter. She just about begins to get her teeth into the matter when the evil powers at work bring about her death after a rather fearsome encounter with ghostly creatures. Now, it is left to Malavika, the daughter to find out the truth. Now enters another character claiming to be the lover of Raj's daughter. His revelations make matters far more complicated and confusing. The matter is thrown wide open and the jigsaw becomes harder to piece together. They discover the death of far more people than they had even thought of and trace it all down to the haunted bungalow. How they get to the bottom of what or who haunts the big house forms an interesting climax.",
