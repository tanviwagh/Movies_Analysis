    "plot outline": "Vishnu (Ramkumar) and Saubhagya (Shruti) are a devout couple, who wish for a child. They make a vow of visiting the Navashaktis (9 goddesses in Karnataka) when they are blessed with offspring. Soon, they have 2 children, Prasad (Master Ramprasad) and Devi (Kumari Arpitha). They also become rich and arrogant, forgetting their vow. Their jealous relatives try to poison their children (so that they get all of Vishnu's wealth). Though the children survive, they lose their ability to speak, and become very weak. The couple are then reminded of their long-forgotten vow, and they resolve to complete it. The jealous relatives insist on accompanying them. First, they all went to visit Chamundeshwari temple in Mysore. As per the vow, the couple climb the hill (on foot) while carrying their children, while their relatives went by vehicle (while laughing at them). The merciful goddess Chamundeshwari (Prema) appeared in the form of a girl and blessed the children so that they could walk. Then, they all went to Kateel to visit goddess Durga Parameshwari. Here, the evil relatives mix poison in coconut water and gave it to the children, thereby poisoning them. Again, the goddess comes and removes the poison, and saves the children. She then punishes the relatives by sending bumblebees to bite them. All throughout the journey, the jealous relatives try to kill the children and disrupt the pilgrimage, but each time, their efforts are thwarted by the goddesses. Finally, at Kollur, they resort to black magic. Aided by a sorcerer, they again kill the children. At this point, the eight goddesses merge in Mookambika and kill the sorcerer and relatives. The children get back their voices.",
