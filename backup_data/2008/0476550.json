        "Arun Prajapati lives a middle-classed lifestyle in a Chawl along with his dad, a retired Municipal employee; mom, and a rather plain-looking sister, Madhu. He is employed with Channel One and is in love with fellow-employee, Alia Kapoor. Arun faces a series of incidents which lead to not only public humiliation but he also ends up losing Alia to a new employee, Rakesh Sharma, and gets fired, much to his father's displeasure. Arun questions God and one morning is granted an interview with Him. A disbelieving Arun meets God and after a short discussion agrees to take over all of His responsibilities for a period of 10 days. During the first 9 days he straightens out his and his family's lives and on the last day he sets about to fulfill the wishes of every human on Earth - and ends up with nothing but disastrous and hilarious results.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"

    "synopsis": "At the end of the worst day in his life, Arun Prajapati (Salman Khan) angrily rages against God for making his life miserable. To his astonishment, God (Amitabh Bachchan) appears before him in human form and endowing Arun with all of his divine powers, challenges Arun to take on the big job and see if he can do it any better.Arun responds to his newfound powers with childlike zeal and sets off making one hysterical yet disastrous decision one after another. The love of his life Alia (Priyanka Chopra) is astonished at the 'new' decisive and confident Arun. He thinks he can make the world a happy place by granting everybody their wishes. But to his horror, this results in unprecedented mayhem. Ultimately, Arun realises that he is only human, and being God is tougher than he thought!"
