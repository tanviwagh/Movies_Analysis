Sara, Pari Vallal's widow who now lives with her adopted daughter Kabini, is astonished and could not believe it. The inhabitants who think it was a practical joke beat him up and tie him with a rope to control him. The next day, Mallika (Poornitha) comes to the village and claims to be Joshua Prakash's wife. After their marriage , Joshua Prakash claimed to be Pari Vallal and told that his parents locked him in a room for 12 years. The villagers first cannot believe him, but his perfect recollections of Kodaikkanal and its inhabitants baffle many. The psychiatrist Elangovan (Thalaivasal Vijay), Pari Vallal's brother, then interviews him and confirms that Joshua Prakash is Pari Vallal. Annoyed by her husband's eccentric behaviour, Mallika decides to leave the place but Joshua Prakash confesses that he loves her and he wants to get a hold of the money hidden by Veeraiyyan. The police commissioner Chandrabose and his team track Joshua Prakash down and abduct him in a cabin in the wood. They force him to show the place, they then find Thennavan's corpse and Sara with the rifle threatens to kill them.
