        "Jodha daughter of Raja Bharmal from Amer is to be married to Raja Ratan Singh who will heritage the crown of her father after their marriage. her cousin Sujamal is upset over losing the throne and joins their rebels.When Mogul Emperor is about to attack Amer Raja Bharmal in order to make peace puts a proposal of Jodha to marry Akbar to which he agreed as it would bring strong alliance between Mughals and Rajput.

Jodha leaves his kingdom after Akbar doubts her character after the truth is out Akbar goes to take Jodha who tells him that first, he should have a change of relation in his kingdom.::alex.mjacko@gmail.com",
        "_Jodhaa Akbar_ (qv) is the story of the greatest Mughal emperor that ruled Hindustan (now India), Jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar, and the fiery young Rajput princess, Jodhaa. Set in the sixteenth century, this epic romance begins as a marriage of alliance between two cultures and religions, for political gain, with the Hindu King Bharmal of Amer giving his daughter's hand to a Muslim Emperor, Akbar. When Akbar accepts the marriage proposal, little does he know that in his efforts to strengthen his relations with the Rajputs, he would in turn be embarking on a new journey - the journey of true love. From the battlefield where the young Jalaluddin was crowned, through the conquests that won him the title of Akbar the Great ('Akbar' in Arabic means great), to winning the love of the beautiful Jodhaa, _Jodhaa Akbar_ (qv) traces the impressive graph of the mighty emperor and his romance with the defiant princess.::AGPPL",
        "Afer the Raja of Amer passes away, his brother, Veer Bharmal, crowns himself king, and looks after his nephew, Sujamal. After he and his wife, Padmavati, give birth to a girl, Jodhaa, they arrange her marriage with Ajabgarh's Rajkumar Rattan Singh. Years later, Veer decides to hand over Amer's reigns to Bhagwandas, instead of Sujamal, resulting in the later approaching Shahenshah Jalaluddin's brother-in-law, Sharifuddin Hussain for assistance. Fearing an attack on his kingdom, Veer approaches the Shahenshah himself, pledges alliance to him, and even offers his daughter's hand in marriage. Jalaluddin, whose life was always controlled by others, decides to marry a rather reluctant Jodhaa, who agrees to marry him on two conditions: that she will retain her Hindu Dharam, and will worship Bhagwan Shri Kishan in the Mughal palace, which he accepts. The marriage takes place, and Jodhaa places yet another condition on him: that she will only get intimate with him after she is ready, which he also accepts. Then Jalaluddin's faith in Jodhaa is shattered when he learns that she has been meeting secretly with a male unknown to him; while Sujamal gets ready to attack Amer; disgruntled and oppressed Hindus, who are forced to pay a toll to their Mughal rulers for their Tirath Yatra, lose hope and faith; while his very own brother-in-law prepares to assassinate him and become the next Shahenshah of Hindustan.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
