    "plot outline": "This is a story about four friends, Hari, Shekhar, Ashim, and Sanjay. They studied at the same school. Ashim studied to be a doctor, but decided to never pursue that profession. Sanjay worked for an ad agency but left the job. The rest have never held a job. They started a Bengali band, but they were beaten up by the public at a stage show in North Bengal. They vowed to never perform again. At this point, they start a travelling agency, called 'Gharoa Travels'. On their first trip, they start the journey with only 9 passengers. On the way to the hills, a girl named Ria joins them. The film deals with their journey through North Bengal. The ten tourist and the four operators form an assorted medley of characters. As the journey progresses, their natures are slowly revealed. The film has a style of flash-forwarding to the future juxtaposed with the present, giving the audience a sense of the fates of the characters even as the story progresses.",
