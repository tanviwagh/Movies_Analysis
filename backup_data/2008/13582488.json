When they enter a moneylender's house to rob, they find the safe completely empty and the moneylender dead. For the crime they haven't committed, they are held as culprits and cops are there chasing them. The two friends, behind the wheel of a stolen car, head to Kodaikanal, a delightful hill station and a perfect place to hide from the police. In the meantime, the film actress Brinda (Poorna) is attempted to be kidnapped by her film financier (C. M. Bala) but she manages to escape. Her greedy mother (Vadivukkarasi) and evil uncle (Kandeepan) will get paid a lump sum if she sleeps with the financier. Without money and exhausted, Brinda reaches Kodaikanal, however, her uncle and his gang are after her. Later, Surya finds Brinda unconscious near a river and he brings her to the stolen car. Brinda who wore skin-darkening makeup and tribe clothes poses as a nomad girl. Surya and Brinda slowly fall in love with each other. Thereafter, the police find their hiding place and are chasing them again in driving rain. During the escape, the rain removed her make-up and Surya is stunned to see Brinda's true face.

Her uncle finally found their place thus he beats up Surya and tries to abduct Brinda. To save them, Nandha plunges into the void with her uncle and both died.
