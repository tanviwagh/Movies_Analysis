However, Ma's anger at Harsh ensures that she takes an instant dislike for Aaliyah, and it is Aaliyah and Siddharth who end up spending loads of time together. This, added to the fact that Aaliyah feels neglected by the career-obsessed Harsh, leads to them being irresistibly drawn to each other. A horrified Siddharth battles this attraction desperately, but Aaliyah has fallen madly in love and pursues him with single-minded determination. When Siddharth's defenses start crumbling and Ma starts getting suspicious, all hell breaks loose in the Mathur family.",

        "Siddharth Mathur (Sharman Joshi), a shy young scientist, travels to Mauritius for his elder brother Harsh's (Sanjay Suri) wedding. Accompanying him is his mother Gayatri (Shabana Azmi), a reluctant traveler since she is angry at Harsh for deciding to get married without consulting them.

This, added to the fact that Aaliyah feels neglected by the career-obsessed Harsh, leads to them being irresistibly drawn to each other. A horrified Siddharth battles this attraction desperately, but Aaliyah has fallen madly in love and pursues him with single-minded determination. When Siddharth's defenses start crumbling and Ma starts getting suspicious, all hell breaks loose in the Mathur family.::RanRay Media",
        "When Mumbai-based Navin Mathur finds out that his Port Louis, Mauritius-based son, Harshvardhan, is getting married to Aaliyah, he asks his wife, Gayatri, and scientist son, Siddharth, to accompany him. Gayatri is displeased as would have preferred to have been introduced to her future daughter-in-law before the marriage, while Siddharth has a project that he has been working on for years that has yet to bear fruit. Upon their arrival, they are met warmly by the couple, but differences crop up especially when Gayatri finds out that Aaliyah's U.S.-based parents will not be attending the wedding. Aaliyah does her best to keep her cool and shows her future-in-laws around the scenic port. This brings her close to Siddharth and she finds herself getting attracted to him especially when she finds that he is talented, sensitive and attentive. She then decides to turn on her charms on him but also realizes that she must first handle the herculean task of convincing Gayatri - a move that may well alienate her from the Mathurs altogether.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
