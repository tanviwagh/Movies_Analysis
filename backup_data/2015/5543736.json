He loves nothing more than his food and films. And there are a few cleverly written dialogues that highlight these, which also evoke laughter from the audience. Tyru is re-christened as Ganapa by the gang lord Jayanna, whose life he saves, and he becomes an intrinsic part of his team. In between the mess, he chances upon a missing mobile, which leads him towards the heroine. They talk and the conversations brew romance.
