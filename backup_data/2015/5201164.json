        "'_Care of Footpath 2_ (qv)', is a story of 4 teenagers who are provoked to kill a cop when their plan goes awry. The juveniles are arrested and tried in the court of law. This becomes shocking national news. The public wants them to be hanged. NGO's want them to be given a chance to get reformed. The Government takes up amendment to try them like adults. The police believe \"once a criminal is always a criminal\". Will they reform in the face of these adversities or will this mistake be held against them for the rest of their lives?::Shrinivas G. Kulkarni"
