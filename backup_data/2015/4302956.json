Every time Kumar Shiv Ram Kishan lands up helping a girl in distress, he lands up marrying that girl! That establishes the fact as to how he gets married to Juhi, Simran and Anjali. As luck would have it, all his wives live in the same apartment. Kumar Shiv Ram Kishan very successfully hides his marriage from all the three wives. And none of them knows the fact that Shiv, Ram and Kishan are one and the same man and cheating on them. The plot gets twistier with the entry of Deepika, the girl he really loves.

The plot gets further murkier when all the three wives become best of friends. The confusion increases when all his three wives are invited on their best friend wedding.",
