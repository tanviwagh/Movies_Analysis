But Nirbaak is a film which does not come with a fixed set of instructions for its interpretation. A tribute to Dali in its truest sense Nirbaak is surreal tale of love. A narcissist, a dog, a nymphomaniac and a woman, the one string which hold these disparate lives together is Love. Srijit Mukherjee does it best when he doesn't follow the trend. In the film Nirbaak Mukherjee plays with symbolism and various unusual metaphors. Nirbaak is a bold step from it's makers part. It is unapologetically distinctive and surreal. The film shows the city of joy as a separate character, which, very few filmmaker has tried to do before. Nirbaak is an experimental film and the makers are to be given due credit for being bold enough to do something of the sort. The minimalist directing style is commendable. Anjan dutta as the self consumed narcissist is a show stealer, Susmita Sen is poignant and subtle with her expressions, Jisshu U Sengupta and Ritwick Chakrabarty has played their respective roles convincingly. Nirbaak with its high shock value is an approximation of unsaid love.",
