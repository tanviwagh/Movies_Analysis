    "plot outline": "Rudhra Veenai is a mystery thriller revolving around the Hindu musical instrument Veena. The Veenai is made by Lord Shiva himself. The Veenai is also Lord Parvati in instrumental form. Miracles would occur when certain tunes were played on it. The Rudhra Veenai arrives in Thodipuram carried by a Muslim man called Nawab Jan Baba, in AD 1702. 300 years later, in the year 2002, Thodipuram becomes the most prosperous village in South India because it housed the Rudhra Veenai. Mysterious happenings occur at Rani Bungalow, where Baba's spirit is believed to be roaming. Only women from the Dasi family could enter and leave the Bungalow without harm. Many people claiming to be Rudhran try to attain the Rudhra Veenai. The claims to be Rudhran are grounded in the logic that only a Rudhran sent by Lord Shiva would be able to play the Rudhra Veena. Who is the Rudhran? Where does the Veena go? Who plays the Veena every night? What is causing the heavy protection around the Rani Bungalow? Why are the Dasi women going to the Bungalow at night and engaging in some mysterious Poojai? All these questions are answered as the show progresses.",
