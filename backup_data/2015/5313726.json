    "plot outline": "This Marathi film is unlike any Marathi film and is based on the Westernized concepts of biking, bike races and biking clubs. Such a club is Biking Adda started by Krrish and his two friends and youngsters throng to this club to show off their biking stunts and bike racing prowess but then Krrish's two friends against his wishes make it a drug addict's haven and a gambling den and a betting sport. Krrish is horrified when he learns this and goes to another of his pet initiatives, saving small children from poverty after getting fifty lakhs as hush money from his two Biking Adda friends. But Krrish is aghast when four of his wards led by Santosh Juvekar join Bikers Adda against his wishes and then the whole film is about the conflict between Santosh, his three friends and the rage when he is taunted by some of his adversaries and his revenge when he comes to know about the real reason behind Krrish's advice of not joining Bikers Adda. Santosh Juvekar looks handsome and acts with great style. The rest of the new boys are adequate. Old veteran Shrikant Moghe shines in a brief role. Prarthana Behere shows why she is one of the rising actresses. Deepak Karanjikar is impressive. Hrishikesh Mandke, Rahulraj Dongare, Shrikant Wattamwar, Nikhil Rajeshirke, Anirudh Hariip, Devendra Bhagat, Tanvie Kishore and Jai Aditya Giri lend adequate support. Music by Vishy-Neemo is adequate.",
