    "synopsis": "This is going to be the best day of your life! DONALD (Barry Primus) promises SAM (Charlie Robinson). This seems unlikely, given that theyre both homeless men mired in the bleak landscape of Los Angeles Skid Row. Moreover, the source of Donalds optimism is a mere $20 bill (a Jackson) which he bummed off a passing businessman (Steve Guttenberg) earlier that day. But Donald vows that with it they can do anything and drags a reluctant Sam off in search of adventure.Directed by J.F. LAWTON, JACKSON takes place in a single day that turns into a cold rainy night. Fueled by bottles of Thunderbird, Donald and Sam end up having a great adventure filled with humor, philosophy, danger and hope. In one of the most unusual aspects of the film, their story is accented by other down and out characters who express themselves by singing some of the worlds greatest opera arias. From an old drunk singing a Donizetti duet with a crack addict, to a bag lady singing Carmen, these surreal musical sequences stand apart from but enrich Donald and Sams journey. What begins as a simple tale about two bums becomes a story about the beauty and resilience of the human spirit."
