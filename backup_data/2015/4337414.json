        "An atheist sues god after losing his shop in an earthquake.",
        "The film is a remake of the 2012 Hindi film OMG and is about an atheist Gopala Rao who sues god after losing his shop in an earthquake and the consequences face by him when religious organisations revolt against him and Krishna visits him as a human to guide him.::Dinesh Reddy",
        "An atheist named Gopala Rao, will lose his shop in an earthquake which is termed as an \"act of god\" by the insurance company. So, they will deny his claim. Gopala Rao files a case against God and drags all the swamijis to the court, as the agents of God.::Thota NAGA KOWSHIK",
        "Gopal Rao is an atheist who lives a middle class life by earning money through a shop where he sells God's idols. But his wife Meenakshi believes in God. In an earthquake, his shop crashes and gives him 80 lakhs loss and he goes to his insurance to claim 1 crore but they reject his plea saying it is an ACT OF GOD...and now Gopal Rao files a case against God in court, including all temples and priests.::Abhinav Maestro",
        "Gopal Rao (Venkatesh Daggubaati) an atheist and a middle class business man appeals a court case on god when his shop is destroyed in an earthquake and the insurance company won't give him the insurance as it is a natural calamity and it is called as act of God. When Gopal Rao was chased by some goons then Lord Krishna (Pawan Kalyan) will appear on earth in human form and protect him from the goons. The ultimate crux of the story is how Lord Krishna help Gopal Rao to win the case and how Lord Krishna will help in believe of God"
