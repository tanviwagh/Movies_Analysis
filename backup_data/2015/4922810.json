The Housing Society where Raghav stays has a temple of Swami Samrath and people out there are very religious and conduct prayers early in the mornings and also in evenings s by playing instruments which creates lots of noise due to this Raghav is not able to concentrate on his project.Raghav being a Atheist ask s the Society Manager to stop all this.Few days go and there is silence in the society and Raghav is able to complete his project but the time he completes his project,Raghav again hears the same sounds again people praying loudly with musical instruments due to a festive occasion this irks him and goes down to stop everything that's happening but gets in scuffle with a devotee Shiva.Raghav calls Dr Vyas and tells that his project is complete but before handling it he has to close the temple in Society Premises forever things happen as per Raghav when he reaches is room he finds that his kid daughter has put unknown password for his project and locked it.Here on Raghav's difficulties start.
