        "In the 18th century, the court of Maratha Kingdom needs Peshwa and Bajirao is nominated. He wins everyone's hearts by his skills and becomes Peshwa, and years later he marries Kashibai. Going to war, a woman from Bundelkhand asks his help and reveals herself as Mastani, daughter of the Rajput king. Impressed by her skills, Bajirao helps her fight her enemies and gifts her his dagger during the Holi festival--not knowing that it's a symbol of marriage.::alex.mjacko@gmail.com"
