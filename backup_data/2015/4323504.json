One day her daughter Sanaya is kidnapped and no ransom is demanded, but instead the kidnapper contacts her and tells her that she has to defend a convicted felon to get her daughter back. The felon is Miyaaz Shaikh who is convicted for rape and murder of a young woman and the case against him is set for judgement in four days. The kidnapper keeps track of Anuradha very closely to make sure she complies with his demand. With the pressure of time against her, Anuradha tries to get help from her suspended police friend Yohan who has been suspended from the police force for flaunting the rules and regulations too often. The case against Miyaaz Shaikh is handled by a renowned public prosecutor played by Atul Kulkarni who has been defeated by Anuradha and hence has a long time professional rivalry against her. How Anuradha races against time and saves her daughter by twisting the laws to win the case is the rest of the plot",
