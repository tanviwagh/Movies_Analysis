The film, follows the great saint on an epic journey across the globe, spreading the Lord's message of equality, peace and 'Ik Onkar'. It's a first-of-its-kind film in about 600 years of Sikh history, and has been depicted through the voice of his friend, companion and disciple 'Bhai Mardana'. Guru Nanak was referred to as 'Shah' by the Muslims and 'Fakir' by the Hindus, the highest honor given in both religions and hence came to be known as 'Nanak Shah Fakir'. - Harinder S.
