        "Karthik (Gautham) is a normal middle class youngster who leads a perfect life with a caring girlfriend Priya (Priya Anand) and lovable family until he meets Panda (Vivek) a small time gambler. Karthik has the power to predict and it is this 'intuition' that makes him an extraordinary person. Together, Karthik and Panda win a big betting amount from Ranthe (Daniel Balaji), who loses ten million rupees and he takes revenge by blackmailing them to roulette in Goa to play for high stakes. Now who wins the cat and mouse game?"
