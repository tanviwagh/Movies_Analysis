When Vicky's dad, Damodar, has a heart attack and is advised to take bed-rest for two months, Vicky fills in his father's shoes, has a confrontation with a senior employee and union leader, Bipinlal Pandey, which results in a strike.

    "synopsis": "Rajoo's synopsis is correct except that the mill is located in Bombay, not Calcutta. Note that in the first scene Amitabh is released from Nasik Road Central Prison; the mill workers speak Mumbaiya Hindi; and the girls who dance at the union rally against Pandey wear Marathi 9-yard sarees. The kite-seller is called 'Bandhu' not 'Bondhu' etc..."
