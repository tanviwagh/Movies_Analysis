        "The story of youngster Bellusamy (Arya), who is impatient and cannot tolerate the wrongs in the society. With his radical thinking and with his principles of communism, he tries to bring a change in the society for better tomorrow. What happens when you pull out all the stops to bring about a positive change in our society? You get framed and fall prey to the wrong side of justice. That's exactly what happens to Arya, who gets a death penalty for alleged illegal undertakings against the country. As a result, he is found on the wrong side of the law being branded as a radical and a traitor and so was convicted to be hanged. Kuyili (played by Karthika Nair)who is also a communist rebel, working in tandem with Balusamy to realize their collective dream of creating a State that would be a model 'dictatorship his love-interest tries to save him from the gallows. How Karthika Nair saves this youth from being hanged.The other two interesting characters in the film are Macaulay (played by Shaam), the young ADGP taking care of the prison in Chennai, Yemalingam (played by Vijay Sethupathy), who is the last remaining experienced hangman in the State and is politically infantile.::Sadiq khan (sadiqkhandirector@gmail.com)"
