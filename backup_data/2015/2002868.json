        "Madhu (Amyra Dastur) is a young game developer and she often gets weird thoughts about her past life, doctors call it as a illusion caused by her job stress while she believes in reincarnation. To Madhu's surprise, she meets everyone in her past life including Ashwin (Dhanush) whom she loved in her past life. Now the big question is, which part is reality and which is Madhu's imagination?::Joel Ajith",
        "Madhumitha, a coder in a gaming company, believes she has memory (only those of courtships, though) from her previous births. Her colleague Ashwin resembles her partner from those births & they fall for each other. As Ashwin tries to prove all of this is her own imagination, her version is corroborated with her information from memory providing cues to unearthing (literally!) a pending case from 18 years back! Was she imagining things? Did she have mystic powers? Answers pour out in the climax.::PipingHotViews"
