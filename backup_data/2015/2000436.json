Determined to provide a safe haven for them, the great asura architect Maya draws on his vast powers of sorcery to build three magnificent airborne cities, named Tripura, each to be ruled over by one of Taraka's three sons. Fuelling the asuric ambitions of the 3 young princes of Tripura, Brahma the Creator grants them a boon of indestructibility, as the cities can only be destroyed by the one and only Lord Shiva ,the Destroyer. Soon enough the asura kings begin craving greater and greater power. Unknown to Maya, they plan a secret invasion of Devlok, the kingdom of the devas. Now Indra, king of the devas, faces a formidable challenge -- defeating an enemy who is protected by the Gods themselves!",
