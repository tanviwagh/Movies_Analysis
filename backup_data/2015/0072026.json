His older brother 'lords' it over the hundreds of serfs who contribute to the wealth of their family. Karan lives an alcoholic, hedonistic life with wine, women and song for companions.

Reduced to rags and a hovel, Savithri, her parents and siblings eke out a miserable life while maintaining their high moral and ethical standards. Is Karan and Savithri's love strong enough to survive the turbulence of high society expectations, greed, poverty and intrigue?",
