    "plot outline": "Agnee 2 is a 2015 Bangladeshi action film directed by Iftakar Chowdhury. It is the second installment in the Agnee film series and serves as a sequal to Agnee (2014). The film stars Mahiya Mahi, Raja G Om, Ashish Vidyarthi and Robiul Islam in pivotal role. Mahi is the only actor from the previous film to appear in Agnee 2. After the initial success of Agnee (2014), Production Company Jaaz Multimedia announced the production of the sequal. Although the film was originally scripted with the cast from previous film, the film stalled for a while due to lead actor Arifin Shuvoo pulling out of the film due to professional difference and scheduling issues. Director Iftakar Chowdhury later roped Indian actors Ashish Vidyarthi for the negative role and Raja Goswami Om for male lead. The film is produced by Abdul Aziz, his production company Jaaz Multimedia funded approximately 70% of the film's budget while Eskay Movies funded the rest. The film is scheduled to be released on June 18, 2015 in Bangladesh and India, during Eid weekend by Jaaz Multimedia and Eskay Movies. Majority of the film took place in Thailand. Agnee 2 was released by Jaaz Multimedia on July 18, 2015 in Bangladesh, and will be released in India in August 20 and Malaysia, Australia and United Kingdom on August 25.
