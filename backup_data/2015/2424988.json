    "synopsis": "There's no one more dangerous than a common man on a death wish. This is one such story of a man remorselessly wronged by the establishment. One freak incident results in everything he held dear taken away from him. Predictably, the system doesn't seem to care - let alone resolve. That's when Ajay (Akshay Kumar) takes matters in his own hands. An underground vigilante army, a secret identity, an elaborate modus...all of these combined make a 'GABBAR'- a true hero, with dreadful villainous instincts."
