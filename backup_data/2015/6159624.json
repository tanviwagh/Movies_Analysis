She notices that the most important person in the family is Ananta babaji, the Guru to the family. Her husband, ShyamSundar serves this person with devotion, and Opalaa, as a result, hated this man. One day Opalaa discovers, to her dismay that the two men had a physical relation and she tries to commit suicide, but Shyam Sundar takes care of her with a lot of affection.
