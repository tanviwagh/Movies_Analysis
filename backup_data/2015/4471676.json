He then went far north to Bhatinda with his next and he returns to familiar territory with 'Ek Taraa'; both location and subject-wise. The film starts in a small village near Alandi with a young Dnyaneshwar aka Mauli (Juvekar) gearing up to participate in a singing talent hunt. The latter part of the film unfolds in Mumbai. The subject being about a singer and his journey in the industry is something that only Gupte could've done justice to considering his association with music. Comparisons with Imtiaz Ali's 'Rockstar' were rife among the audience and 'Ek Taraa' does have a resemblance to the Ranbir Kapoor starrer but only in bits and pieces. Like 'Rockstar' it is based on your typical boy-next-door's journey to the top and his eventual fall from grace. But the premise is entirely different and so are many other elements associated with Mauli's journey which ranges from simpleton to contest winner to arrogant star to an addict to losing everything and coming back to square one.",
