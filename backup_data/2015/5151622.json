    "synopsis": "Rahul, an engineer, tries his best to protect his wife from a goon feared by all. The goon wants to marry Rahul's wife at any cost, and this doesn't bother him whether she is already married or she has a son. In the process, Rahul tries to take help from the law, but all efforts go awry, and the tables turn on him. When finally everything goes against him and his wife, he turns into an angry man, who is on a rampage to protect his wife by all means, even if it means killing the goon, and giving him the worst death he can ever wish for.What follows further is a story that is filled with action, drama, thrill but no diversions from the script. Ranbanka is a highly octane action film that is filled with intensity which can't be estimated until and unless you watch it."
