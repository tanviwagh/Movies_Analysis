        "The inept tactics and safe methods used by the police inspector of the crime division where Mathimaran works as a constable, irks him as he feels he is not able to do complete justice to his job as a result. When he is challenged to find a powerful case to prove his worth, he stumbles upon one such at the hospital where his girlfriend works. As he digs deep, things get personal and nasty and he gets himself and those around him into a perilous situation. His attempts to wriggle out of it and expose the perpetrators, forms the rest of the story.::PipingHotViews"
