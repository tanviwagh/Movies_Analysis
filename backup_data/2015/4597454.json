One Brit took control of the land because of the value of the sand there and his family has been in control of shipping out that soil to develop a huge fortune. The film shows two stories, the capture of the village around 1947 and in the present time when a descendant of the village hero has taken a job there to become a police officer and becomes a hero in his own right. There is a lot of action in the telling of these two stories, but there are plenty of laughs between our current hero and his girlfriend who will do almost anything to get them married.",
