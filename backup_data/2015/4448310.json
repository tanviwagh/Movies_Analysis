        "The lives of Sathya, who works as an Emergency medical technician (EMT) on the State sponsored 108 Ambulance and Arumugam, who functions as its driver, get rudely interrupted by a snobby old man, Kailasam. The film captures the travails of both as they becomes progressively irritated by Kailasam's words & actions.::PipingHotViews [Anand]"
