This arrangement worked as the girl with whom he shared room had day shift. They communicated with each other through writings. But one day suddenly he had to leave due to his fathers death resulting into no financial support for him. He chose to not meet the girl to keep his memory as pleasant colorful one as meeting her will spoil that feeling. Otherwise he would not have made the movie 8 to 8 so successfully.

She takes an aggressive interview which was enough to break him.He then tells this young beautiful girl that he thinks that she is not real as he doesnt even know her name. He only knew that her mothers name is Sherene. She says that he should ask who is he instead of asking who is she.He then remembers how he got attracted to a woman much older than him when he was very young and was in Tamil Nadu as his dad who was in military got transferred there. Actually that woman used him to get a prey for her husband to get anal sex on K.K finds out this beautiful young girls name which was Aastha. He stills misses Sherene and talks to her in his imagination. Aastha gives her a watch as gift which she claims is a time travel machine.K uses it and to his surprise it really worked.
