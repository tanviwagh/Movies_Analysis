        "Two law graduates Karthik & Mellina looking for a place to set up their offices. They invariably end up sharing the same house without knowing that they both are of the same profession. They would forgo and adjust with almost anything but the fact that they both belong to the same profession. Much to the agony of having each other's company, they find a reason to chagrin one another and fight to make a business out of cases. This goes on until they each discover a growing passion for each other. When all seems rosy, enter the villain.::PipingHotViews"
