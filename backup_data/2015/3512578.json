Rwik and Sahana are journalists from Calcutta, who visit '_Jhumura_ (qv)', a fictitious village in Purulia to do a story on 'Jhumur', an almost dying folk art.

        "The fondness in his eyes allures me, I crave for the ballad of his flute, They steal my heart in a flash...This tune is the focal point of the lyrical saga. Two young journos visit Purulia (in rural West Bengal). Their sole aim is to compile a research on 'Jhumur', the famous folk art form of Purulia. They reach Purulia and come across an elderly couple. They are traditional Jhumur performers. On their account, they discover an unheard tale of love, hatred and compassion that commence with the tune of Jhumur and culminate in the serene locale of Purulia. There is an exquisite game of time and space throughout the film. A mystic time-traveler holds the chord between two eras.::Anonymous"
