        "Banaras-based Vidyadhar Archarya re-locates to work as a Medical Representative in Mumbai. A real estate agent gets him a flat in the A-Wing of Sales Tax Colony and warns him that he could be evicted anytime due to surprise raids by the vigilance department as occupation is only limited to government employees. He nevertheless moves in, and his first night is disrupted by his new neighbor, a Kolhapur-based upcoming model-singer, Mehak Malavde, who is throwing a late-night house-warming party, and numerous people ring his doorbell late in the night. Grouchy, he complains to the watchman - to no avail. The next day he complains to the building committee and faces ridicule. He decides to get even by playing devotional music - and is accordingly admonished by the very same committee. Unhappy with these turn of events - he is in for more shocks when he will find she has moved in his apartment without permission after being evicted from her's. Watch what steps he takes to assert his authority over his space.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
