His world revolves around a doting mother, a passion for music and the memories of a childhood friend, Sameer, who left Goa for Mumbai many years ago and hasn't replied to his frequent letters ever since. Pinto's talent for music is only matched by his knack for finding trouble in the unlikeliest of places often resulting in the most outlandish and hilarious situations. When Pinto's idyllic world is shattered by the sudden demise of his mother he decides to head to Mumbai in search of the only friend he knows. Will Pinto find Sameer or will trouble find him first? Will Pinto and his crazy antics survive the big bad city or more importantly, will Mumbai survive a phenomenon called Pinto?",

Will Pinto and his crazy antics survive the big bad city or more importantly, will Mumbai survive a phenomenon called Pinto?::Anonymous",
        "Born in Goa, naive Michael Pinto lives a middle-classed lifestyle with his widowed mother, and has a mentor in Father Simon. He uses snail mail to stay in touch with a former friend, Mumbai-based Sameer Sharma, who refuses to acknowledge nor communicate with him. When his mother unexpectedly passes away, Simon counsels him to re-locate to Mumbai and find a career with the help of Sameer. Simon accordingly contacts the latter and asks that he receive Michael at the airport. Sameer, who has employment pressures, as well as an ambitious wife, Suhani, who is all set to being promoted as Creative Director, is not too thrilled about the entry of Michael in his complicated life. An unknowing Michael has no clue that soon he is in store for a life-changing experience and will be involved with an assorted group of people - including gun-toting gangsters, kidnappers, a Caucasian female named Maggie, an alcoholic movie star, Reshma Shergill - and a roller-coaster ride, in bizarre and strange surroundings.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
