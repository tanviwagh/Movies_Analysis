In the train, they meet Bharathi (Sathish) and Shwetha (Aishwarya Rajesh) but the young lovers soon leave them. The next day, in Nagercoil, Vallal and Vennila who have no money struggle to survive.

Vennila's family helped Vallal financially to go abroad. Thereafter, Vallal and Vennila fell in love with each other and had to elope.
