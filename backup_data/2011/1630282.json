Fauji is then hired by the personal assistant, Rawat, of the Chief Minister, Jaya Gulati, to disrupt the non-violent agitation led by Malik against the government's Land Acquisition legislation - that empowers it to acquire land at very low compensation from farmers and allot it to powerful and influential industrialists like Aggarwal - who has paid her a huge bribe. Rajbir and his crew find out that the village is their hometown and decide to support the activists. They are turned down as the group does not want their demands tarnished by involvement of ex-convicts/goons. They then decide to play a dangerous double-game, abduct Jaya's son, Hitu, and decide to hold him until such time the government changes it's stand. Hoping to help the activists, as well as acquire substantial money for themselves, they will not be prepared for life-threatening consequences after Hitu escapes.",
