        "Ram Kapoor lives a wealthy lifestyle with his wife and two married brothers, Lakshman and Bharat. He would like his son Prem to marry U.S.-based Pooja Malhotra; Prem refuses, but he picks her up at the airport and brings her home and everybody approves of her. Prem discovers that she's really Sanjana Singh, a runaway bride who had refused to marry the brother-in-law of her feuding maternal uncles, Amar and Suraj Chaudhary. The Chaudharys manage to locate Sanjana and snatch her back; coming to her rescue, Prem gets into a physical confrontation with Aryan Chaudhary, injuring him so grievously that he goes into a coma. To get Sanjana out of the Chaudharys' clutches, Prem faces the Herculean task of not only getting himself accepted, but also facing off against Aryan, who's on the road to recovery and then the road to vengeance.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
