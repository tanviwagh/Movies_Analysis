In order to escape police scrutiny, the duo flee in their recreation vehicle, and are joined by an irate gun-toting male, Jai Dhumal, who blames them for the delay in getting to his wedding with Muskaan.

Things get worse after they get robbed by a hitch-hiking couple, Geetanjali and Arjun, which compels them to abandon the RV, and return home via plane. Jai also tells them that he is actually eloping with his future bride as her father and brother, Veeru, disapprove of him, and are in the process of forcing her to marry a male of their choice. Afraid of losing her, Jai convinces them to try and arrive on time. Little do they know that even if they do arrive in time - Murphy's Law will prevail - resulting in even more confusion and chaos for everyone.",
