        "In a bid to extract one Crore Rupees from wealthy businessman and widower, Taneja, four Mumbai-based amateur gangsters: Raghuveer, Abbas, Govind and Ajay abduct his only child, Isha. They decide to hold her captive with once-wealthy and now indebted Kantilal Shah and his family. Things do not go as planned, however. The hapless foursome end up opening the door whenever the doorbell rings, and ending up with more hostages, including the Shah's maidservant, a real estate agent, a money-lender, a doctor, a pizza delivery boy, and even an off-duty cop amongst others.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
