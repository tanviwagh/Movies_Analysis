Mohit does change his mind about Hanumant when he witnesses the latter break the laws as well as accept bribes and shares it with other police officers with impunity. Mohit will not only face career and personal challenges when he decides to oppose politically-connected Hanumant, but also when Varsha, along with two other journalists, will be abducted by Islamic terrorists.",
