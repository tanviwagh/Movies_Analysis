        "Rakesh Kadam, a truly honest inspector of Goa (Colva) police kills himself as he could not live with the thought that people disgrace him of being a tainted police officer. He was framed in a corruption case as Kadam was proving to be a major blockade to gangster operations in Goa city. His wife Megha (Sonali Kulkarni) takes it upon herself to fight against the odds. Meanwhile, Jaykant Shikre (Prakash Raj), a notorious gangster, takes on Megha and accuses her of trying to clear her husband's name while flaunting his good side during media interactions. Shikre is ill-famous for dacoity, extortion, kidnapping, killings, land grabbing, and other related oppression. Another valiant, charismatic, and self-disciplined police inspector Bajirao _Singham_ (qv) (Ajay Devgan) who operates in his unique style - solves cases conventionally without summoning people to his police station in Shivgad. He becomes very popular in his village and simultaneously falls in love with stunning Kavya Bhosle (Kajal Agarwal). And, a heartwarming love story unfolds between the two. In a High Court directive wherein Shikre was told to present himself, for a different case, at Shivgad police station, but he refuses to do so as the village is located very far on the borders of Maharashtra and Karnataka. Although, self-styled Bajiroa summoned him and enraged Jaikant travels all the way to the police station where he was received uncongenially like a small-time thug. Devastated and humiliated with the insult in front of his army of goons, Shikre ensures inspector Bajirao gets transferred to the city as to wreak vengeance on him. Shikre challenges his ethics and beliefs - an attempt to belittle him after being transferred to Goa (Colva) police station. Bajirao is shattered up to the extent that he wanted to leave the job and go back to his village Shivgad. And, that is where Kavya jumps in and convinces him to stand-up against Jaikant Shikre and his dreadful goon gang. Megha has been meeting with ministers, high-rank police officials and vainly insists on CBI inquiry into her husband's case, however, she gets nothing but disappointment. The news breaks out of Shikre contesting local elections and he wins. Bajirao never misses any opportunity to set Shikre up, but to no avail since corrupted senior police officials, bureaucrats, and ministers have never lent any support to weed out gangsters like Jaikant. Bajirao is the only inspector after Kadam who stood up sternly against him. Justice has been denied in Goa city since Jaikant's rise to power until one-day Bajirao with entire Goa police force rose to the occasion, launched an offensive against Jaikant Shikre and he was killed few hours before his oath-taking ceremony as minister. Inspector Rakesh Kadam gets clean chit posthumously and was praised for his role in the eradication of crime from the city.This powerful action-emotional drama is one of the finest works of Rohit Shetty and Team.::Javid Ali",
        "Bajirao _Singham_ (qv) is an honest cop in small town of Shivgadh with a respectful family.Jaikanth Shikre a corrupt politician in Goa has to present himself in Shivgadh for a case related matter but sends his proxy which _Singham_ (qv) does not accept.Jaikanth Shikre arrives in Shivgadh to defame _Singham_ (qv) but gets insulted by _Singham_ (qv) and villagers._Singham_ (qv) is soon transferred to Goa with powerful contacts of Jaikanth where he tortures him like anything and sees the police in the region are helpless due to his power._Singham_ (qv) decides to fight back and Jaikanth fears for his life.::alex.mjacko@gmail.com"
