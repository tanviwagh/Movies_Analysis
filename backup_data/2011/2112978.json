        "Delhi-based Rohan Bhatia, the only son of widower Brigadier Dalip, successfully obtains his MBA degree, decides to party with others, including girlfriend No.31, much to his father's displeasure who wanted to spend some time with him. He then re-locates to Mumbai and gets hired by 'Bombay Bulls' as a stockbroker where he, and dozens of others, are given a period of three months to reach the top 10. He befriends a long-time employee, Vikram Khurana, and is introduced to wealthy widow, Amrita Singhania. Rohan also meets with an aspiring model/actress, Neha Kapoor, and successfully woos and beds her. His father and Neha want to spend quality time with him on the occasion of his 25th birthday but he travels to Goa to meet with Amrita to become her Fund Manager. This meeting becomes intimate and he ends up spending the night with her. Shocks and disappointments are in store for him when he returns to Mumbai when he finds Vikram has decided to invite his father for lunch; a physical altercation results with his co-worker, Akash, and he ends up being reprimanded; but nothing will prepare him for the shock when a displeased Neha will inform him that she is not only pregnant - but not interested in seeing him anymore.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
