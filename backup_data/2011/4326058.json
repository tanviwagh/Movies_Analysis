The family that wins the race gets a chance to perform the very important Shiv Puja for that year. For years, Dhananjay Rao (Sachin Pilgaonkar) has been winning the race for Gayatri's (Neena Kulkarni) family. One time, Pratapsingh (Vidyadhar Joshi) employs crooked methods to make Dhananjay loses the race. His bullock cart meets with an accident, killing a few people and injuring the bullocks. Devastated by the incident, Dhananjay migrates to the city. He returns after five years, but refuses to take part in the annual bullock-cart race. However, circumstances force him to take part in the last bullock-cart race. Dhananjay will now have to face the mighty Pratapsingh.",
