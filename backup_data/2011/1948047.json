Unable to handle this, and hoping that Shruti will change her mind, he fools his family into believing that she also loves him, and abducts her. Watch what impact this kidnapping has on Raj, the entire Tyagi family, as well as on Rameshwar and the rest of the family - especially when they find out that Vivek has been lying to them.",
