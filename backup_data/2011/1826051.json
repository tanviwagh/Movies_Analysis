        "This is the story of a strong 35 year old beautiful and a famous choreographer divorced with two kids, living alone and is forced by her peers and family to remarry and find a father for her kids. She promises that she will marry any guy that loves her children as much as her.::DaGambit",
        "Based in Mumbai, Aquarian Simi Nagpal reflects on her marriage with Aditya, followed by the birth of two children, and a very bitter divorce. She now lives with her children, runs 'Simi's Dance Academy', and has been nominated for an Award for choreography. She meets with Raj Arora, who enrolls himself in her academy, befriends her and her children, and she falls in love with him. Hoping to marry him soon, she will instead face nothing but bitterness when his mother will not only reject but also humiliate her and warn Raj not to see her again - while Raj will expose his hidden agenda - and Aditya prepares to re-enter her life.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
