        "While making a speech at the Peace Festival in Germany, Home Minister Manohar Kamat collapses and is hospitalized, diagnosed with an unknown strain of the Ebola virus. The Indian authorities assign this matter to the Research and Analysis Wing, who in turn instruct Agent _Aazaan_ (qv) Khan to investigate. He does take up this assignment but soon ends up being a suspect as evidence surfaces that his once-humanitarian brother, Imaad Khan, maybe involved in this conspiracy. Dejected and devastated after he learns that his brother has been killed and with no clues about the terrorists nor any treatment for this virus, he is befriended by statuesque Moroccan beauty, Afreen, a sand-artiste and the mother of Zara. The trio face danger from known and unknown sources, while a foreign power works together with the terrorists to unleash this virus on approximately one billion Indians turning them into self-destructive suicide-bombers.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
