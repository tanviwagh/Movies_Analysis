        "Based in Bhindi Bazar, Mumbai, Mamu is a gangster, who leads a gang of men and women who pick pockets of civilians on busy streets and over-crowded BEST buses. His wife, Bano, manages all household work, and after getting overwhelmed, gets her cousin, Shabana, to re-locate and live with them. Bano soon finds that the latter is more interested in her husband but is unable to assert herself. After a steamy bout of intimacy with Shabana, Mamu's heart fails and he passes away. A power struggle ensues - with a rival, Shankar Pandey, deciding to get more assertive - resulting in a gang-war. Amidst a rapidly spreading influenza virus, Fateh decides to take over the reins from Mamu, while Shabana takes an active interest in the former as well as makes plans for a seemingly helpless and widowed Bano.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
