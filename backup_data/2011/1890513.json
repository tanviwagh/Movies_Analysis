        "Uday and Ragini decide to travel to a friend's farmhouse in the country and spend some time together. Upon arrival, Ragini finds the entire bungalow rigged with cameras, and Uday is recording their movements on his camcorder. They settle down to have some fun but are soon interrupted by two friends, Priya and Vishal, who are en-route to Matheran. The foursome chill together, but Vishal gets upset when he finds that Uday is not pleased by their presence, and they quickly depart. Finally alone, the two try bondage and intimacy but will be interrupted again - this time by a malevolent and vengeful Marathi-speaking entity.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)",
