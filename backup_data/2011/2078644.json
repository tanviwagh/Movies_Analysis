        "_Indian Rupee_ (qv) is a satirical dig on today's youth who attempt to make quick money without sweating it out. Prithviraj is a small time real estate dealer based in Kozhikode, who dreams of making it big some day. Prithviraj is in love with his Rima Kallingal, who is a doctor, though her parents are yet to approve their alliance. Prithviraj along with his friend (Tini Tom) is scouting for a land deal. He works under a senior agent (Mamukoya) but wishes to break free as soon as possible. He sees light at the end of the tunnel, when Thilakan, an old city dweller approaches him to sell off his land assets. The deal never happens, but Thilakan stays back with them. Prithviraj manages to earn a decent fortune after some smart moves, but he learns some valuable lessons in the process, about the importance of earning money honestly in life.::Anonymous"
