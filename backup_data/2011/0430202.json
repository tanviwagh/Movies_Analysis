When his mother asks him to return, he explains to Nisha that if he takes her before they are married the people would make an issue of it and promises to return in 4 days.

The Zamindar had approached his mother to fix the marriage but she told him that she cannot fix her son's wedding until her daughter is married.

        "Swami Trilokanand predicts that a devotee, Sher Singh alias Shekar will get married to two different women. Sher Singh scoffs at this, and only wants to get married to Bombay-based Marathi-speaking beauty, Nisha. Then Sher gets summoned to his hometown in Punjab, where his disabled sister is getting married to a young man named Harpreet. Upon arrival, Sher is told that Harpreet is only marrying his sister on the condition that he marry his sister, Sweety. Unable to refuse, Sher gets married to Sweety, spends several nights with her and returns to Bombay and is told that Nisha is getting married to Vicky Chopra without her consent. Sher gallantly steps in and marries Nisha. Sweety and his mom re-locate to Bombay and Sher leads a double life with his wives. Nisha and Sweety both get pregnant and give birth to two look-alike sons, Tuktuk, and Tony. When the children grow up, they find out that their dad is deceiving them, and matters come to a head where Sher actually admits that he did commit bigamy - only to be confronted with a real look-alike of his - who claims to be Nisha's husband. The question remains, who is this intruder?::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
