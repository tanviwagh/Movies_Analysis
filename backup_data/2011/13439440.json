    "plot outline": "A mysterious group kidnaps a politician, an advocate, a businessman and a police officer. The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Thamizharasan (Thol. Thirumavalavan) pressures the police to find the culprits. Ilavarasu (Yuvaraj), the leader of the group, contacts Thamizharasan via email and tells him why he had to kidnap them. Ilavarasu was a carefree student who lived with his parents and his sister Jaya. One day, Raghava, the brother of the local don Kottai Kumaraswamy (Muthuswamy), and his friends eve-teased and molested Jaya in a shop. Ilavarasu and his friends caught them and took them to the police station. Raghava and his friends were then sent to jail. A vengeful Kottai Kumaraswamy threatened Ilavarasu's family and made their lives miserable. Ilavarasu's father sought the help of ACP Venkatesh and filed a complaint against Kottai Kumaraswamy but Venkatesh being Kottai Kumaraswamy's loyal man threw away his complaint. Kottai Kumaraswamy's henchmen continued to tease Jaya and one day, Ilavarasu and his friends beat them up. One of the rowdies died during the fight. Kottai Kumaraswamy's henchmen then kidnapped Ilavarasu's family and Kottai Kumaraswamy brutally killed them. The journalist Kathir (Sougandhi), Ilavarasu's girlfriend Aarthi (Madhuchanda) and his four friends (Ajay Pradeep, Adith, Kannan and Babu) decided to help him. Back to the present, Thamizharasan feels bad for what happened to Ilavarasu and wants to help him. The next day, on live television, Ilavarasu and his friends introduce the hostages: corrupt politicians, corrupt police officers, corrupt advocates, fraudster businessmen and rowdies. They beg Thamizharasan to fight against social evils like corruption and rowdyism and they ask him to abolish bail. The public strongly supports the students and their request. Thamizharasan also decides to support the students, he asks them to release the hostages and promises to clear them. When Thamizharasan went to see the governor, his car exploded and on the news, Thamizharasan is pronounced dead. At the headquarters of Thamizharasan's party, the politicians have a savage fight on who will be the next leader of the party and the governor dismisses the current government. A few months later, Thamizharasan returns alive just before the election. Thamizharasan tells the media that he was saved by the students that day and they were protecting him from the people who tried to kill him. With the support of the students, Thamizharasan is reelected as chief minister and he finally abolishes bail.",
