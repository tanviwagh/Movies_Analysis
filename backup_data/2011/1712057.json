    "synopsis": "Vaanam is a high profile tamil movie which is critically acclaimed worldwide. It revolves around five people who are referred to as the five elements. The stories of all these people converge at the climax. Simbu is a cable worker, anushka is a sex worker, bharath is an emerging rockstar, prakash raj is a muslim affected by prejudice and saranya is a poor woman who's only aim is to make her son study by settling all her debts. The movie has a star studded cast and is the remake of the telugu hit vedam. It is not the usual south indian film you get to see in theatres it is a class film. The performances of all the main actors have been phenomenal. They deserve national recognition"
