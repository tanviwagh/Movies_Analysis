    "plot outline": "'Don Ghadicha Daav' is the story of a young woman - Vaidehi Sarpotdar (Sai Tamhankar), whose invalid husband - Arjun Sarpotdar (Sayaji Shinde) is murdered. A stranger, whose car breaks down near Sarpotdar's bungalow walks in and identifies himself as Saumitra (Makarand Anaspure). He comes to the rescue of Vaidehi, who is confused in such a situation and then he draws a plan , taking advantage of the night hour with lightening and heavy rains outside. The finger of suspicion obviously points at the young widow- Vaidehi, Arjun's step mother (Kanchan Adhikari), Arjun's mentally challenged step brother Babul for property reasons and a person called J. P. whose son has been crushed to death under Arjun's car. There is also one more suspect in the form of family friend Dr. Umesh Sontakke (Ajinkya Dev) , who befriends Vaidehi. Everyone has a different version on how the actual murder took place and that makes Police to go into details of investigation. Finally, the real murderer comes forward with his revelations and surrenders before the police, when they are about to arrest someone else.",
