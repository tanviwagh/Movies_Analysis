Siri too has her boyfriend in her heart. Her marriage is fixed with one Uday (Navdeep), a US return. The day comes when the guy from the US arrives in Hyderabad to take the hand of Siri. A situation arises that Uday and Ritu believe that Siri and Chandu are in love with each other. Friendship or love, which wins at last? It would form the crux of the story.",
