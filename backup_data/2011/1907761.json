With extra classes being imposed on both students and teachers, and the recess-breaks being doubled, parents are also forced to pack more food in lunch-boxes. When students evade Babubhai and continue sharing food with Stanley, he calls the latter aside and warns him that he cannot attend school until and unless he brings his own food.
