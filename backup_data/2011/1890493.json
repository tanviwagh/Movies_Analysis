He falls in love with her and then rescues her. But Tony found out that Niharika was already engaged to Rakesh. Rakesh is a goon (and the minister's son) but Niharika doesn't know that. When Niharika found out that he was a goon, she dumped him. And she also came to know that she is in love with Tony. Later on Tony kills Rakesh and captures his son DSP Jr.(Sai). Later on when Tony, Niharika, and Chitra (Payal Ghosh) go to the temple, Chitra sees Tony killing someone. And then there is a flashback about how he and Niharika met before but she lost her memory. That happened because Niharika's brother was an undercover cop and when goons found out they killed the whole family. The only one who survived was Niharika but she had a bullet in her head. The doctors said that she would lose her memory soon. So, she tells Tony to kill the people who killed her family because she had seen Tony beating up a bunch of people. In the end tony kills all the goons who killed Niharika's family.",
