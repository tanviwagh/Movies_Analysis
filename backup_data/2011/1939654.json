Ajit then attempts to kill him but instead falls overboard. Bharat unknowingly throws up a life-jacket, while Ajit's goon pushes him overboard. The next day the duo wake up on an isolated island and Bharat makes himself virtually at home, starts singing old Bollywood songs much to Ajit's chagrin who is desperate to get back home in order to attend a meeting. Waiting for a quick rescue, the duo will be in for quite a shock when they find they are not quite alone on this island.",
