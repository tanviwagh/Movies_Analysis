Mistaking them for real police officers, the residents welcome them and even prepare a feast for them. They decide to make themselves at home - not realizing that soon they will not only be pitted against the police - but also Durjan - who had killed two men just to steal their video camera; looted two villages to purchase an antique car; and set fire to this town's Police Station, killing nearly all policemen - and is all set now to confront and do away with them.",
