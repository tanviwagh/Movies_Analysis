He shows up again the next day with the same task, and keeps on coming daily. She finds out that his name is Andrew Raymond and he was a fellow student during her school-days. He admits that he had a crush on her and had even agreed to wait 10 years to see her. She takes a liking to him and both hang-out together while she attempts to deal with her creditor, Gangaram, and increasing pressure from R.K. Constructions who want to build a resort. Then her world will shatter around her when she finds out that Andrew had been killed several years ago, and the male claiming to be him is actually an unknown and unstable inmate from the local mental institute.",
