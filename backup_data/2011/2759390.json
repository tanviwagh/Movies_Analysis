    "plot outline": "Those were the days when Indian freedom struggle against British rule had gained momentum. Young Shivaramu is going from place to place building awareness about the struggle, obviously avoiding the scrutiny of Police. On one such occasion, he loses his way in the hilly terrain and thick forest. Local people bring him to Gopalaiah's house at Kelabailu to spend that night. In deference to loving pleadings, he stays on for a few days. His exposure to various facets of life in these few days unfolds a whole new world in front of him. Beautiful minds of people living in the hills and forests; their innocence - hospitality - native wisdom - rituals - culture; their living in harmony with Nature; simple life of Gopalaiah and his wife Shankari; their cares and concern for people around them; the success- story of Gopalaiah's spirit of adventure in developing a beautiful Kaatumoole farm in that very forest area even in the face of challenges thrown up by Nature; Gopalaiah's zest for life even in his old age; Shankari's constant yearning to see her only son SHAMBU living far away from them for long; Gopalaiah's hurt feelings for the same reason; the way various characters open up in front of Shivaramu about SHAMBU - each with his/her own guess-work, apprehensions, sense of guilt leading each of them to introspection; - all these bring a new awareness to Shivaramu and help him understand the true meaning of life and living. This film BETTADA JEEVA is an attempt to capture these complex issues which strengthen the bonds of human relations.",
