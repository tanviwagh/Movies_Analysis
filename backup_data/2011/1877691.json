    "synopsis": "Love Breakups Zindagi is a movie which tries to answer the question related to love, breakups and life.Jai (Zayed Khan) and Naina (Dia Mirza) are almost settled\" in their life but missing something or someone who will complete them. Jai feels that magic and serendipity have passed him by. Naina has taught herself that a less than fulfilling life is enough for her. But is it? Govind (Cyrus Sahukar) has a colourful past and is on his way to another major, seemingly all wrong relationship. But what if this 'mistake' is the love he has been looking for all his life? Sheila (Tisca Chopra) has stayed single for a long time waiting for Mr. Perfect. When he does appear, will she take her chance at love, look beyond the odds that divide to see what binds them in a perfect whole? Ritu (Umang Jain) lives on breakups and ice cream. Will she ever find a man, and share a beginning and not just a closure? Arjun (Satyadeep Misra) and Gayatri (Auritra Ghosh) are the perfect couple on the brink of a dream wedding. Will their love inspire the others to listen to their heart? Dhruv (Vaibhav Talwar) and Radhika (Pallavi Sharda) are driven workaholics ignoring the small text of their lives. Will they wake up to see what they have missed in their desire for everything?\nThe characters try to find personal truths, shed illusions, laugh, cry, grow up and learn the biggest lesson of all. That even if you don't go looking for love, it will come looking for you."
