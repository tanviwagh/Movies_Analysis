But Vasudevan, suspects foul play & moves into the same apartment complex that Ramya lived, in-order to investigate further. While police investigation is underway in the neighborhood, people who are associated with the case are killed under seemingly mysterious circumstances.

The spirit recounts the story of Ramya's marriage to Bala and their life together. In the early days of her marriage, Ramya inadvertently confesses her past relationship with Vasudevan to Bala, after which he develops a strong jealousy towards Vasudevan.
