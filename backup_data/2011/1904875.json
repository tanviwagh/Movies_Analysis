When the race of Punjab's Chief Minister turns personal with current Deputy CM's son getting murdered, a blood war seems impending. Amidst this frenzy, Squadron Leader Jasdeep Singh Wadala the prodigal son of the Deputy CM returns to find out the reality behind his brother's death. How the young politician reaches the perpetrator with all the parties involved, is what gives the plot a suspenseful and very entertaining ending.::Abhishek Pandeyar"
