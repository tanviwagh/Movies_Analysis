        "_Khap_ (qv),a contemporary tale of traditional massacre opens in the capital where two youths Ria and Kush fall in love. Meanwhile news channels highlight the death of Veer and Surili,who are found dead in Omkar Chaudhary's village.Ria has no idea that Omkar is her grandfather.Madhur, Ria's father,had left his native village due to differences with Omkar over the ruthless pratha (tradition) of honour killings, Madhur is chosen to lead a commission to investigate the suspicious deaths of young Veer and surili. Torn between his love for his son and his strong belief in the pratha, Omkar promises Madhur that he would put an end to these ruthless killings.::Anonymous",
        "After witnessing brutality at the hands of his Sajodh-based widower father, Omkar Singh Chaudhary, Madhur re-locates to Delhi along with his wife, Komal, and daughter, Ria. Sixteen years later, Ria is now in college, while he is an Investigator with 'Human Rights'. He is asked to travel to his Haryana village to investigate the alleged suicide of a couple, Veer and Surili. The locals, including the fathers of the couple, Daulat Singh and Sukhiram respectively, admit that the couple had killed themselves, and are not interested in pursuing this matter. Investigators find that the deaths are one of many that have taken place in a region that is still bound by _Khap_ (qv) Panchayat. It dictates that couples cannot marry distant relatives nor can they have an inter-caste/inter-religious marriage with impunity as police/politicians refuse to intervene in this centuries-old outlawed custom. As he delves further into this issue, he ends up being attacked, is hospitalized and subsequently passes away. Komal and Ria move in with Omkar and eventually settle down in the seemingly peaceful village. Omkar finds out Ria is in love with fellow-collegian, Kush, the son of South Africa-based Jagmohan and Saroj Mitter, and arranges their marriage. After the couple return from their honeymoon, they will find themselves pitted against the entire community after the Masterni unlocks a secret from their respective pasts.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
