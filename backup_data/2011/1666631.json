The gift of living your life through the life of another brings immense joy, satisfaction and blessings, it gives both to the person who does the good deed and to the one who receives it. Its a simple story of a visually impaired orphaned girl, Rabia who is offered a better life when a young couple makes a conscious decision of adopting her and she fills the vacuum in their lives. Then through a twist of circumstances when the protagonist comes to know she is going to die, she makes two important decisions that would change Rabia's life and another young woman's life. What'd be her second decision for that the audience has to wait and watch the movie.",
