Though hesitant at first, he agrees, as it is his dad's (Bhagyaraj) dream to see his son in a government job. Veluthambi reaches this remote village where everyone including small kids work in brick kiln for livelihood. These illiterate people are taken for a ride by the employers who do not want the kids to be educated. Veluthambi brings about a change in the system due to his humanness work and dedication. How the 'Vaathiyar' to the villagers, achieves it and at what cost forms the rest of the story. The scenes and characters in the village like the running one-up-manship between Vimal and Thambi Ramiah over a maths riddle or the city bred hero not knowing the customs and rituals in a village that brings a smile. A goat chasing Vimal, and his scenes with the children are a scream. The soft romance as Iniya tries to woo Vimal is also a delight.",
