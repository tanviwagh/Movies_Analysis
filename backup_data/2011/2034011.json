Crestfallen at her loss, Shabana returns home but the duo follow her there, and are told that she likes both of them but her life and marriage is not under her control. Both will soon find out what she meant when they will be abducted by her gangster uncle, Punju Don, who intends to get her married to one of them - but first he must try and test them if they are suitable to carry on with a life of crime. The hapless duo must now try to outdo each other in trying to get out of this situation - regardless of the impact this will have on poor Shabana.",
