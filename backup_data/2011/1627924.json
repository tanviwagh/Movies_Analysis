Hoping to woo and marry her despite receiving romantic overtures from village belle Lajjo, he instead faces heartbreak following the attack on Babri Masjid by right-wing Hindu extremists. Seeking safety in Bombay, Aayat re-locates there with her father and Bua. The couple are then fated to meet in 1999 in Scotland, where Harinder is now an Indian Air Force Pilot and Aayat is a ballet dancer. They rekindle their romance and set a wedding date. Unfortunately, the Kargil war compels Harinder to return home, and Aayat doesn't hear from him and doesn't know that he has been gravely injured and his left arm is paralyzed. After being discharged, he still hopes to connect with her, but when he returns to Scotland he is told that they have relocated to the United States. Following the events of 9/11, he gets a lead that she might be in Switzerland. He travels there and locates her rather dramatically, but nothing could have prepared him for the shock of finding her resting on the shoulder of an unknown male with a child on her lap.",
