One day when he is chasing criminals, he meets Maya and falls in love with her. He had previously thought that no woman could ever touch his heart again.

When both find their happiness of love, however, fate wants Surya to kill an Underworld Don named Drug Manja. His angry and extremely dangerous brother Tamate Shiva seeks bloody revenge, and does not stop at the relatives or the lovers of the brave policemen who are involved in the case.",
