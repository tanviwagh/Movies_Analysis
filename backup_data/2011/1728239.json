They intrude in his life, find out he is having an affair with a woman named Gulabo, and blackmail him into making them partners.

With an enraged Bata on their tail, the hapless foursome manage to escape to Macau with help from gangster Mohsin Bhai. Here they run into Kabir, now the owner of 'Four Jokers' Casino, and make elaborate plans to avenge their humiliation as well as ensure that he winds up alone and penniless.",
