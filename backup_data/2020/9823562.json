The girl's father 'Kanwar Mahinder Singh' (played by the talented comedian B. N. Sharma), who works for the Punjab Electricity Board, is already unhappy with his family, office workers and his whole life. He is a very superstitious person which causes laughter and fun. With many ups and downs because of a gangster, an astrologer, a hypocrite, and various circumstances, the story proceeds in a comic and interesting way. Will the Meet get his love, will Fateh become a singer, will enthusiasm come back in her Kanwar Mahinder Singh's life?
