        "An investigation follows the rape and murder of a police woman. A wealthy but dysfunctional Christian family, belonging to the landed gentry of the area, gets accused as the primary motivators behind this crime.Through the investigation, the audience becomes witness to stories of love, lie, honor and greed of the family members. The investigation, though non-conclusive, slowly progresses on a journey from sleepy hills of the _Kottayam_ (qv) to the brooding border areas of India and China, where some the characters end to be pawns in a more pressing issues the nation is facing.::Binu Bhaskar"
