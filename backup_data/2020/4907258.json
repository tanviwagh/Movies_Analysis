There is a compounder in a hospital of that village who has strived for years to come into politics but the villagers do not give him more importance. One day this compounder comes to know about a game of scam which is being done in the name of the government compensation, and he promises this wager a bike in return of his support in that game. He has an aim to represent himself as a guardian angel of the poor to fill his own political motive. Both of these common men pass through the funny and interesting events which makes you laugh and also expose the untouched and unseen issues of their society.",
