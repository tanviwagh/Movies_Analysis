        "\"Rummy\" is a lawyer murdered by Don \"Jayanna\". However Rummy has unfinished business in the physical world and he wishes for a second chance at life. His wish comes true as his spirit splits from his body. Without a physical body, he is a ghost neither seen or heard by humans. He can walk on water and objects pass through him but, he is unable move any physical objects. Unaware of Rummy's death Vandana, his lover searches for him. The plot capitalizes on the assumption that dogs can see spirits. Hence Bhageera, a dog is able to see him. He accidentally meets a senior ghost Chiranjeevi who becomes his mentor. Rummy needs to take revenge on Jayanna and convey Vandana that he is no more. How he does it forms the rest of the story."
