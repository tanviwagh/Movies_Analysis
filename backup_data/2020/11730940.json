    "synopsis": "Nasir Jamal is a young mischievous teenager. His friends call him 'Naate' despite being\nquite tall. Naate brings home complaints regularly. His father however, a reputed and\nwell-known contractor overlooks his son's deeds and in turn encourages his behaviour\nfor the worse while his mother is worried sick about her son and his carelessness.\nOne evening, Naate goes to drop off a parcel at Sanam CD shop on Zahid's request,\nNaate's childhood friend. There, he finds the shop closed and coincidentally meets a\nyoung girl, Neelam , who lives right above it. An interesting conversation takes place\nbetween them. Soon after, they happen to meet a few more times by chance and\nNaate is now drawn to her. It's not very different for Neelam, she appreciates Naate's\ngenuine gestures toward her and wants to let him in, however she seems hesitant\nwhen things start to get real. Having had a tough journey, she battles to make things\nwork with Naate, but he's too light hearted about it all to see any red flags.\nWhile Naate and Neelam get closer, Jigar Fareedi, a seemingly charming, influential\nperson and an idol for many youngsters alike crosses paths with Naate on account of a\nfight between Rajeeb Mehndi, a college student politician and Nasir.\nJigar demands that Nasir make a public apology and is arrogantly turned down leading\nto the beginning of an ego conflict between the two.\nNasir also has quite a reputation in college, he's notorious and invites trouble quite\ncomfortably. He cares for Tota, his dear friend and is ready to go any extent to\nsafeguard his interests. This inevitably causes a lot of trouble in college.\nNeelam struggles to understand her relationship with Naate, but is aware of how much\nshe has grown to like him. They face multiple obstacles and are presented with testing\ntimes to really explore their journey together and what it would mean for them to stay\nhappy anywhere.\nThis leads us to find out whether Naate and Neelam will ever be able to be together?"
