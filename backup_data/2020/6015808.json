        "A rising heart surgeon's life takes a turn he never expected and soon everything comes crashing down. He soon finds himself a former big city doctor turned small town doctor. It could be the worst year of his life or just what the doctor ordered.",
        "After a spectacular fall from grace, high-flying heart surgeon Dr. Hugh Knight receives a life-changing punishment from the Medical Tribunal - he is forced to work for a year as a country GP in his former home town of Whyhope. _Doctor Doctor_ (qv) follows Hugh's attempt to rebuild his world in the town he has spent his whole life running away from. Now the only way to salvage his brilliant career is to work as a lowly GP in an under-resourced, small-town hospital surrounded by estranged family, former friends, crazed colleagues, oddball patients, jealous brothers and a newlywed ex-girlfriend."
