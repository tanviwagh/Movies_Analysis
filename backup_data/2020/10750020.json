        "Sakthi is a petty thief in a Chennai slum, who learns the Adimurai, the ancient and oldest form of martial arts, to fulfil his father Velappan's destiny. Meanwhile, an evil man and his son challenge Sakthi for a kickboxing tournament, and Sakthi agrees to participate in it.",
        "Sakthi, a thief, turns into a mixed martial arts fighter after he meets Kanyakumari (played by a mature Sneha). He has his roots in Adimurai, an ancient martial art, considered as the base for every other martial art in the world. Sakthi's father Thiraviyamperumal (also played by Dhanush) is an exponent in the artform, and how he influences Sakthi forms the plot.",
        "The film begins in 2001 with a woman, Kanyakumari, being sent to prison for murder. The action then cuts to the present where Shakthi alias _Pattas_ (qv) is leading a happy life that involves some small-time thievery and playful retaliation against Sadhana, a snooty neighbour. The latter makes him steal from her workplace, a mixed martial arts academy run by Nilan. But _Pattas_ (qv) realises that he has a history with Nilan, when he meets Kanyakumari, his long-last mother. She wants him to avenge the murder of his father, Thiraviyam and bring glory to Adimurai, the ancient martial arts form that he practised.::Santhosh"
