    "synopsis": "Anjani, a young migrant, battles hordes of monkeys as a contractual monkey repeller, a newly created government job to tackle the monkey menace in the heart of Delhi. His job profile entails mimicking aggressive langurs, the original and extremely effective employees for the task- recently let of on account of animal rights. The sacred pests shred Anjani's dignity and courage in quick succession, and make such a mockery of his professional ineptitude that an early discharge seems imminent. But when admonished by his pregnant sister, Anjani grits his teeth and decides to counter monkey business with monkey business of his own. The struggles and misadventures of Anjani become the lens to examine the realities and contradictions of contemporary India. The underside of a farce, after all, is its involuntary participants. The narrative of the film is shaped by extensive use of non - fiction elements, incorporating non-professional actors alongside trained actors. V\u00e9rit\u00e9 footage is mixed with crafted mis-en- sc\u00e8ne to weave a revealing account seeped in reality, which is as stark as it is absurd.The film premiered at the International competition section of the 3rd Pingyao International Film Festival, China after which it had its India Premiere at the MAMI 2019, Mumbai where it was awarded the Golden Gateway Award (Best Indian Film) as well as the Young Critic's Award along with a Special Mention for the lead actor of the film. The film was also awarded at the NFDC Film Bazar, Goa where it was a part of the Work-in-Progress Lab and has been completed with the support of the PJLF Arts Fund, Paris. The film had its European premiere at the Panorama section of Berlinale 2020."
