        "In tumultuous Mumbai, at a time when scheming Maharashtrian politicians use violence to rid the state of North-Indian migrants, a terminally-ill lone wolf Maharashtrian cop _Bhonsle_ (qv) retired against his will, finds himself forging an unlikely companionship with a 23-year-old North-Indian girl and her little brother, which brings the raging conflict to his door. He prepares himself for one last battle worth fighting for, but it might just be too late."
