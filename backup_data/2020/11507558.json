A year back his father had committed suicide as he is unable to pay off his bank loan. The Bank decides to seize their property. On the day of his wedding, his in-laws back-off and decide to cancel the wedding as Mukund (Mukya) has lost his property to the bank. Mukya runs from pillar to post seeking help to save his property, but no one comes to his rescue, frustrated with the events of his life, and in an inebriated state he posts a 'Kidney' sale advertisement on an online website. A rich Arab who is in need of a Kidney seals the online deal and comes to India to claim the same. Thus Mukund gets entangled in a kidney racket and has cops chasing him. 'Vikun Taak' is Mukund's funny struggle to save himself and prove his innocence and also highlight the loopholes of the system.",
