Every person has a certain time to live in this world and it's important to understand how one lives his life. Abhijat also knows that he has a certain time to live his life and nobody is immortal. He realizes that there are so many people who need help and he starts helping them in their problems which gives him confidence in himself, a great sense of satisfaction and very unique identity. Abhijat teaches us a very important lesson that there are two most important days in our life, one the day we are born and the next when we find why? when you help others and live your life meaningfully you will be the happiest person on the earth. In the journey of life, we forget to live our lives and become negative. But the moment we realize the correct way to live our life we start enjoying it.The film beautifully conveys to people that whatever is left in their life is something very special.",
