        "Avinash comes to a city where everyone wants to kill him.",
        "Avinash(Anil Kapoor) went to Calcutta for no reason. After meeting with Reema (Rani Mukherjee), he starts having flashbacks about his past and his son. His inquiries take him to Bombay via the _Calcutta Mail_ (qv), and this is where he will find out whether his son is alive or not, or he has been trapped.::Malika Dwarka",
        "Avinash (Anil Kapoor) Comes to Calcutta in search of god knows what? And suddenly finds himself engulfed with too many people interested in following him. This creates distrust in his mind to believe anyone around him. Avinash meets a lot of people like a shrewd politician Satish Kaushik, the so-called loyal Inspector Rastogi (Sayaji Shinde), Sujan Singh the joker, the one always interested in helping others but believes none of them. He meets up with Rima (Rani Mukherjee) a novelist whose activities are quite suspicious and puts him in a quandary as to believe if she is really Rima or Bulbul. Totally it puts the hero in a lot of dilemma as to what is the real matter behind all these happenings and who is interested in killing Avinash.::Manisha",
        "Sanjana and Avinash live in Calcutta, India, with their only child, a son. One day Avinash witnesses a crime being committed and comes to the assistance of the victim, and takes him to hospital. This does not auger well with his assailants, and they kill Sanjana and abduct their child. The police are involved, but unable to trace the child. A heartbroken and desperate Avinash decides to take matters in his own hands and begins inquiring. His inquiries take him to Bombay via the _Calcutta Mail_ (qv), and this is where he will find out whether his son is alive or not, or he himself has been lured into a deadly trap.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
