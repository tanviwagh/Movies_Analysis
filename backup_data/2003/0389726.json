She studies in the Arts Commerce and Science college in Bombay, and is summoned home to get married to a man of her family's choice, to which she reluctantly agrees. On the day of the marriage, a dancer performs an item which angers Mahadev, who is the Mukhiya of Mandaur, another lawless town, where the groom hails from. Friction breaks out, guns are drawn, people are killed, and Amarpur's Mukhiya, Jawahar Pandit, decides to torch the harvest of Mandaur and flee. An angered Mahadev instructs Shiva to wipe the Sindoor from Vidya's forehead, make her live the life of a widow, and not permit her to re-locate to her husband until he avenges this humiliation. Vidya is thus imprisoned in her home but shortly thereafter manages to convince her dad and Shiva to let her return to Bombay where she can continue to study and find a job. Shiva seeks Mahadev's permission and as a result Vidya is permitted to leave Amarpur, leaving her family as virtual hostages just in case she decides to join her groom in Amarpur. During the train journey she has company of three males and two female students and finds that one male student is interested in her. After her arrival in Bombay, she meets with the young man again, an Engineering student in the same college, and is afraid he is stalking her, so she returns home to Amarpur. Watch what happens when this young man, whose name is Diwakar, a resident of Mandaur, follows her to Amarpur - setting off a chain of destructive events that will change and perhaps even shatter their's as well as the lives of everyone in Amarpur and Mandaur.",
