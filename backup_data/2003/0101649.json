        "15 year old Kalyani gives birth to a baby boy, wraps him up in a yellow cloth, and leaves him in goods train coach which contains bags of rice. This child is transported in this manner, until the train comes to a stop, and some children enter this coach to steal the rice, and on being challenged by a railway guard, the children flee together with the child, and leave him in a nearby river. The river transports the child to a slum, where he is picked up and looked after by the community in general, and is named Surya. Years later, Surya has grown up and is affectionately regarded as a kind-hearted man, who will help anyone in distress and trouble. One day Surya defends a woman, and gravely wounds a man molesting her. This man is hospitalized, and subsequently dies. As a result Surya is arrested by the police, and severely beaten. It is then Devraj, a much feared gangster comes to Surya's rescue, and gets him out of custody. Surya finds out that the man he killed worked for Devraj, and he becomes indebted to him for life, and both become close friends. Their friendship is tested when a new Collector, Arjun, comes to this community, and is bent upon arresting Devraj, and Surya is instructed to kill him immediately. Surya agrees to do so, not knowing that Arjun is none other than Kalyani's son.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
