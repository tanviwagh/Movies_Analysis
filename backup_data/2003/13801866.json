    "plot outline": "In Chennai, Raja (Aravind Akash) and Manik (Yugendran) are best friends since their childhood. The orphan Manik owns a garage while Raja is a college student. Manik's garage stands just in front of a ladies hostel where Nithya (Sona) lives and Manik is in love with her. Raja and Nithya are collegemates and lovers. The morning, Nithya acts as a soft-spoken woman to the hostel warden and she leaves the hostels in a traditional dress which makes Manik falling in love with her. But then, she goes to her friend's house, changes her dress and goes to the college in modern dress. Nithya is also an outspoken and straightforward woman who hates male chauvinism. Manik decides to impress Nithya's father Shanmugam (Malaysia Vasudevan) who lives in a village and Manik helps him sorting out a case. Shanmugam then promises him to give his daughter in marriage and Nithya finally sees Manik at the engagement in her village. The day of the wedding, she elopes and arrives at Raja's home. A distraught Manik starts drinking alcohol. In the meantime, Raja and Nithya get married in a temple in Chennai. Later, Raja introduces to Manik his newly-wed wife Nithya and the two are shocked. Manik then promises Nithya that he will not tell anything to Raja. Nithya doesn't want to be a typical housewife doing housework so she starts to behave harshly towards Raja's family. Raja tries his best to bear her arrogant behaviour and the situation worsens dramatically day by day. Manik then plays a double game: on the one hand, Manik advises his friend Raja to behave violently towards his wife and on the other hand, Manik blindly supports Nithya in her decisions. Three years later, Nithya and Raja live separately from each other and they are now busy with their professional career. To prove that the women are equal to men, Nithya asks Manik to marry her at the registrar office and invites Raja. The day of the marriage, Manik refuses to marry her and humiliates her. Manik tells Nithya that he doesn't do it to take revenge on her but to make her understand that Raja is a good husband who is still in love with her. Nithya realises her mistakes, Raja forgives her and the couple hugs each other. The film ends with Raja and Manik happily shaking hands.",
