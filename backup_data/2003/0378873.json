    "plot": "Long-lost 'Unni' returns after a long span of time, though mentally challenged. Several attempts are made by his family and villagers, to recover his mental illness. But some unexpected incidents, form the plot.",
    "synopsis": "The master (Nedumudi Venu) and his wife (K. P. A. C. Lalitha) is waiting for Unni, their only son who is missing for many years. 10 year old Unni got lost in the crowd during a temple festival where he was along with his neighbour Panikkar (Oduvil Unnikrishnan). Panikkar too did not return since he decided to return only after finding Unni. Ammu (Kavya Madhavan) is Panikkar's daughter who also believes, like master and his wife, that her father will return one day with Unni. The master finds Unni and brings him back to the Village.\nThe villagers realizes that Unni is abnormal and is mentally challenged. He behaves like a small boy and creates all sorts of trouble for the villagers and his parents. His main hobby was \"Mundu collection\". He will snatch the Mundu worn by people in the village after aiming at it with a hand gesture resembling Okay gesture. This leads to a series of comical incidents in the village. He is given Ayurveda treatment under the guidance of the church priest (Jagathy Sreekumar). Ammu looks after Unni, which her cousin (Nishant Sagar) objects to, as he loves her. Eventually, Ammu starts to love Unni and waits for his recovery to marry him.But finally Unni gets back his memory only to let out the truth that he is not Unni but Vishnu, the son of a Bangalore don (Thiagarajan).\nThen the story unfolds Vishnu's earlier life and tragedy."
