        "_Khushi_ (qv) Singh (Kareena Kapoor) is the only child of Vir Bhadra Singh (Amrish Puri) from Punjab, India, and he has loved and pampered her all her life, until when he asks her to get married. She reluctantly agrees, but then the groom had other plans, so _Khushi_ (qv) decides to relocate to Bombay, India to continue with her studies. She meets with Karan Roy (Fardeen Khan) from West Bengal, India, and both fall in love. To complicate things, Zohravar Singh (Sharat Saxena) has sworn to avenge himself against Karan, for marrying his daughter, Priya, to a poor college student, Vicky. _Khushi_ (qv) is puzzled about Karan's relationship with a woman named Madhu, and has seen him under very intimate circumstances with college student, Roma. The two are unable to reconcile their difference, and then it is now time for Karan to return home to re-locate to Canada, and _Khushi_ (qv) must return to her home, and marry the man her dad has chosen for her.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
