    "plot outline": "Its a fun masala romp with generous helpings of the recommended masala allowance. There is feisty Hirni (Zarina Wahab) who wears backless cholis and sells liquor while her smoking hot boy-friend Jaamlia (Vinod Khanna) languishes in prison. Then there is the college-going Rekha (a very subdued Neetu Singh) whose attachment to Hamlet is exemplary -- she goes to bed with it. Her hair goes from shoulder length to waist length in the space of a few moments. Perhaps that is why a visiting drunkard -- Anand (Shashi Kapoor) -- falls for her and stalks her in a bordering-on-harassment song sequence. Mahendranath (Bharat Bhushan) is a rich and lonely old man with a smarmy new manager Dilip Singh (Prem Chopra). Mahendranath had a much younger brother Rajen (the annoying kid from Fakira) - a willful brat who left home one day, never to be heard of again. Instead of heaving a sigh of \"good riddance\", Mahendranath keeps hoping Rajen will return. Taking advantage of the old man's hopes, Dilip hires an unemployed youth (Raza Murad), to impersonate the lost-and-now-grown-up Rajen. Mahendranath happily hands over all his property to \"Rajen\" and is promptly murdered by Prem. \"Rajen\" himself is bumped off later.Things get more complicated with new twists and thrills at every turn. Someone is sending Dilip threatening letters about Mahendranath's murder. Jaamlia is fighting off goons who land like flies in Shaitan Chowki to evict the residents. Anand makes a pact with Dilip to get Shaitan Chowki vacated. But is he tricking the residents or Dilip? While all this is happening, Rekha is mysteriously absent from the scene.",
