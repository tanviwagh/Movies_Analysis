    "plot outline": "Deepak (Deepak Dinkar), Suja (Suja Varunee), Ramesh (Ramesh), Payal (Payal), Bhagya (Bhagya) and Karishma (Poorvaja) are carefree plus two students. Deepak lost his mother at an early age, and his father (M. S. Bhaskar) married another woman. Deepak cannot concentrate on studies because his father is making love with his wife in front of him at night. The students' only aim is having fun in class and making fun of teachers. The schoolboys spent much of their time smoking cigarettes, reading erotic novels, and chilling out eyeing for girls. The strict school headmaster A. Swaminathan (Vadivelu) has an authoritative stance. He makes their lives miserable and takes every opportunity that he has to sanction the students. One day, Bhagya attempts to commit suicide when Swaminathan humiliated her in front of the other students. Tired of Swaminathan's punishments, the students decide to get revenge on him. This led the students to take a radical decision, thus they hire the naive snake charmer Muniyandi, who looks exactly like Swaminathan, to act as the school headmaster. Thereafter, the students kidnap and sequester Swaminathan, the Tamil teacher, and Deepak's father. The uneducated Muniyandi becomes the new headmaster; therefore the students do whatever they like during the classes. One night, Suja, Payal, Bhagya, and Karishma drink a lot of alcohol. The drunk girls then join the boys and fell asleep in their beds. The next morning, they wake up with a jolt and were just wearing towels. They suspect the boys for having sex with them when they were sleeping. Deepak swears that they only changed their clothes which were full of vomit, but the girls did not believe him. In the heat of anger, Ramesh, Eashwar (Eashwar), and Pradeep (Pradeep) decide to lose their virginity, so they hire a prostitute. The prostitute confessed that she did this for paying her little brother's studies and advised the boys to focus on studying. Later, the police raided the brothel and arrested the three friends. The boys are thereupon released from jail. Deepak and his friends free Swaminathan, and they all apologize to him for being so immature. Meanwhile, Ramesh's mother Lakshmi (K. R. Savithri), who worked so hard for paying her son's studies, was so heartbroken that her son went to a brothel that she prepares a meal, which she has poisoned herself with. During the school lunch break, Lakshmi usually brought the lunch and feeds her son Ramesh, but this time, she asks Ramesh to feed her. He feeds his mother, but after only a few bites of food, Lakshmi dies in his lap. Ramesh and the other students mourn the death of Lakshmi. Ramesh, who is deeply affected by her death, starts to behave like an insane person: he opens a book and starts studying.",
