        "Aniruddh and Niharika are students studying in the same college and fall in love. The college politics is dominated by two rivals, Gauri Shankar and Ranvijay Singh. One day, Aniruddh sees Ranvijay escaping (after committing a murder), and helps him evade Gauri Shankar's goons. Ranvijay is thankful and Aniruddh gets to know him better. As time goes by, Aniruddh moves closer to college politics, heavily swayed by Ranvijay, much to the chagrin of Niharika and his family who warn Aniruddh against Ranvijay. Matters come to a boil when Aniruddh commits a crime instigated by Ranvijay and is forced to flee to Bombay under Ranvijay's protection. As Aniruddh fumes and festers in Bombay, desirous of meeting Niharika, things take a turn for the worse as Niharika's father promises her hand in marriage to someone else. Aniruddh must now return for Niharika, but things quickly heat up as he discovers that Niharika's prospective groom is none other than Ranvijay.::Amodini"
