Unable to resist, he asks her whether she would show him her home. It marks the beginning of a passionate affair, during which Kabir is told that Sonia's husband neglects her. But Sonia cannot leave him because she cannot support herself without her husband's money. Sonia suggests murder and Kabir, blind with lust, agrees.

They embark on an affair, which leads Sonia to convince Kabir to murder her husband, Rohit Khanna. Kabir soon finds out that Sonia's motivation for the killing was to get her hands on her husband's money and property, not to run away with Kabir. The movie ends tragically.::gavin@sunny_deol2009@yahoo.com",
        "Unemployed and idle Kabir Lal sees a beautiful lady, Sonia Kapoor and falls for her instantly. She ignores his attentions. They meet again, and she tells him that she is married, and apparently being abused and neglected by her wealthy spouse, who she cannot divorce as he is rich and wealthy, and she cannot survive on her own. She encourages Kabir to meet with her, and subsequently convinces him that they can only be together after he kills her husband. Consumed with passion and lust for Sonia, Kabir agrees to do this, not knowing that Sonia has other plans up her sleeve, not only for him, but for her spouse, and a mysterious stranger, who is unknown to Kabir.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
