After a not-so-pleasant initial meeting, Ashwin slowly falls in love with his college mate Bharathi (Rathi Arumugam). She later understands his true love and reciprocates. After completing their studies, they meet in a temple. Ashwin fears that they might get separated and asks Bharathi to marry him right away at the registrar office, but Bharathi, who is a practical girl, has other plans. She wants Ashwin to find a job, and then she would marry him with the consent of her family. Ashwin cannot trust her since he had witnessed many lovers getting separated during their college year. An offended Bharathi scolds him for his lack of trust in her and runs away in hurt and anger. Ashwin goes back to Ooty, while Bharathi and her family relocate to Coimbatore. Two years later, at the alumni reunion, Ashwin meets his old friends and Bharathi along with Ashok (Yogan), a family friend. Ashok tells Ashwin that he will soon marry Bharathi. Later that evening, Bharathi said to Ashwin that she was not aware of it. She then swears that she will definitely marry him and apologizes to him for running away that day. When she came home, her parents reveal that they have found a groom for her: Ashok. She convinces her parents about their marriage. Thereafter, Ashwin finds a government job in Coonoor.

When she arrives at Coonoor, heavy rain was occurring over the hills, and it triggered landslides that swept aside everything in its path. Ashwin's office collapsed in front of Bharathi; in shock, she passed out. Many hours later, the rescue personnel found Bharathi and Ashwin. Ashwin survived, whereas Bharathi died of her wounds.",
