        "Six city students take refuge in deserted ruins when stranded on a highway and start telling one another scary stories to keep amused. The stories include: A husband trying to scare his wife; a man stuck at a creepy \"healthy hotel\"; a teacher spooked by a child's homework; a housewife scared of apples; a bizarre lift on a freeway; and a college kid with an unusual power. Unlike the usual Indian horror film, this does not resort to sound effects and visuals for thrills. Each sketch has its moments, though a couple of them could have been brilliant with small script changes and a resistance to oversimplifying. Most of the actors do decent jobs, especially Raghubir Yadav as the freaked-out teacher.::Joyojeet Pal",
        "A group of friends are stranded in a remote rural area when their vehicle breaks down. After exploring their whereabouts they find an abandoned house and decide to spend the night there, sharing supernatural and horror stories. The friends disappear one by one, and nobody seems to know what happened to them. As the remaining friends share stories of the occult, they realize that some are missing and go look for them. Then the real horror strikes.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
