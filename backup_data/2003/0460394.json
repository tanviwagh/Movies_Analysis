    "plot outline": "Irfan Khan (Pavan Malhotra) is a key mafia affiliate in Mumbai. Khan is on the wanted list of criminals in Hyderabad with a bounty of 50 lakhs. Aiming to migrate to Dubai so that he could remotely control the operations in Mumbai, Khan devised a plan of hijacking a plane from Hyderabad to Kathmandu. His plan consisted of getting four of his own men to hijack a domestic flight from Hyderabad to Kathmandu(destined for Mumbai) in which he is a passenger. The home minister is also in the flight, and the four men are to release all the passengers and concentrate on the Home minister. From Kathmandu, he planned to go to Dubai. For the hijack operation, he organised a group of four intelligent men who were in dire need for money and who do not have a criminal record. The audience is made to believe in the beginning that the four central characters are these four men, but in fact they kidnap Khan before the flight takes off, aiming to get the prize money. They hide Khan in a forest and call the Assistant Commissioner of Police, who is a double agent for the mafia. When the ACP does not yield(as he wants them to release Khan), one of the four, Kumar, does a deal with the Mafia and obtains a bag with 2 crore. However, the bag in which the money is kept in has a bomb in it. When Kumar tells the others that he has done this, they back out, and he also joins with them, just in time. Meanwhile, Khan's assistant, Musharraf, comes and takes Khan from the forest, but is stopped by IB agent Zaheer Khan, who has been following the four men and Musharraf all throughout the movie. Finally, the four friends come back to their house and find a bag which they had lost with a note from Zaheer explaining everything. The bag also has, to their joy, their prize money.",
