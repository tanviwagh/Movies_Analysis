        "Rukhsana Jamal and Anwar had been married for several years, and have two daughters, _Tehzeeb_ (qv) and Nazeen, from this marriage. Anwar goes through a period of mental instability and depression, which ends in his committing suicide by shooting himself dead. Years later _Tehzeeb_ (qv) and Nazeen have both grown up. _Tehzeeb_ (qv) has married Salim Mirza, while Nazneen is mentally unstable. Their fairly smooth lifestyle changes abruptly when _Tehzeeb_ (qv) finds out that Salim is having an affair with Sheena Roy; and Nazneen comes across a loaded revolver.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)",
        "Rukhsana Jamal is an invincible singer who has been recording private albums besides filing playback to film songs, since years. Come trends and fads, she's a survivor. A one stage of her career a major scandal had erupted. Her daughter _Tehzeeb_ (qv) has never forgiven her. In fact she has sought to move away from the shadow of her mother. After a break of nearly 5 years, the mother and daughter meet for a reconciliation. They two are excruciatingly polite with each other until the masks of courtesy fell.::gavin (gunmasterM@hotmail.com)"
