        "FOOTPATH begins with Arjun narrating his story in flashback mode. As a child, he lived in a Mumbai slum with his father who was a workers' union leader. Two street kids Raghu and Shekhar, and their sister Sanjana were his best friends. But one day his father was murdered by anti-unionists and Arjun took revenge helped by his friends. He fled to Delhi soon after. Cut to the present : 20 years passed, and police came to Arjun with a proposition. Raghu and Shekhar were drug dealers and police wanted to reach the top man of the crime ladder through them. Or else Arjun will be charged of past murder. Reluctantly Arjun accepts the offer and joins Raghu's Mumbai gang. Side by side he hooks up with Sanjana who has estranged herself from her brothers. But the police inspector (Aman Verma) who gave the offer to Arjun in the first place has received an order to conduct an \"encounter\" of the two brothers . So Arjun must reach the \"big fish\" within 30 days if he wants to save his friends .::Soumitra",
        "Arjun Singh and the Srivastav brothers, Raghu and Shekhar, are neighbors in a gangster-prone area in Bombay. When Arjun's union leader father is killed, the brothers urge him to avenge his death. They get a gun and find the killers - and kill them. Arjun is the prime suspect in this homicide and the brothers get him to run to Delhi, where he begins life anew as a Real Estate Agent, Mohan Kumar Sharma. Years later, Arjun returns to Bombay and is welcomed with open arms by Raghu and Shekhar, who are now leading gangsters by their own right. Arjun also renews his romance with the estranged Srivastavs' sister, Sanjana. Sanjana would like Arjun and her brothers to go straight, and Arjun agrees with her and he starts to work on Raghu - the more flexible of the two - and partially succeeds - especially since Raghu is romantically involved with a school-teacher, who will have nothing to do with him unless he gives up all criminal activity. Raghu is seriously considering going straight when Shekhar gives him the devastating news - that Arjun is not who he claims to be - but a plainclothes police officer - who is out to get them by hook or by crook.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
