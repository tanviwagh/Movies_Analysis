        "A traveler decides to assist a woman involved in a murder.",

In just a moment Chandrashekhar gets attracted to Rani and when the police gets informed about this incident the duo decides to fabricate a story to fool them.

        "Chandrashekhar's car breaks down in the middle of the night amidst a thick fog in the country-side. Taking his flashlight, he approaches a nearby house, and knocks on the door. Upon getting no answer, he finds that the door is open. Once inside, he observes a male seated in a chair and asks his permission to use the telephone. When he gets no response, he gently nudges this male, and the body falls down. Chandrashekhar goes over to the telephone to phone the police, and it is then that he sees a young, beautiful woman with a gun in her hand. He is attracted to this woman, though he knows that she killed this male. The woman identifies herself as Rani, the wife of the dead man, and admits to killing him due to his abuse and atrocities. Chandrashekhar feels protective towards this widow, and together they concoct a tale to fool the police, and create a description of a ficticious robbery suspect, without realizing that the person they described is real, and has been arrested for this homicide. It is then the police and the prosecution realize that there is more to this homicide than they imagined.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
