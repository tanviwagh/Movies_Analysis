        "Sushmita and Jaanbaz live in India, and they are in love. They intend to marry, but Sushmita's family is strongly opposed to the marriage, since Jaanbaz is a Muslim and they are Hindus. But Sushmita and Jaanbaz do get married, and Jaanbaz takes her with him to his country--Afghanistan. On the way there, Sushmita is horrified to see mutilated corpses, bomb explosions, and armed militants. She is terrified and asks Jaanbaz to take her back, but Jaanbaz takes her to his home. Jaanbaz's family is delighted with Sushmita and welcomes her. But some members of his family regard her as a non-believer. Soon, Sushmita is given a Muslim name, Sayed Kamal and, later, gives birth to a baby girl. Sushmita's attempts to flee with her daughter are all in vain. Is she destined to live in a country where women have no rights, bear abuse all the time, and cannot even leave the threshold of their dwelling without a male escort? How can one woman and a child escape from the Taliban?::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
