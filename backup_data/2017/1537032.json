        "Mallanna, a CBI officer, raids corrupt people, Triple P being one of them. When Mallanna intelligently turns tables on Triple P, he lands in trouble. Triple P's daughter Subbalakshmi arrives and starts to seduce Mallanna strongly, with the aim of seeking revenge from him. Mallanna too doesn't get easily carried away, and pretends to be in love with her. Meanwhile, a jealous DIG always tries to find cases for Mallanna. But what no one except Mallanna and his team knows a bigger secret about Mallanna himself: He's a superhero. CBI officer in the day and a rooster superhero by night. With enough power and support from his team and the public, despite of Subba's seduction and enmity with the corrupt officials, Mallanna sets out on a mission to disclose every hidden secret of corruption in the system.::Prashast Singh"
