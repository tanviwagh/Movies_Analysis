    "synopsis": "Bhoomi is an intense action drama about the relationship of a father and his daughter. Arun, a shoemaker has been living life peacefully with his daughter Bhoomi and brother Taj. He runs a shoe shop and is respected by one and all. Bhoomi is about to be married but all the happiness comes crashing down when she gets kidnapped and raped by three men.She honestly reveals about her rape to her to-be husband whose family on the day of the marriage breaks it. Moreover, upon dragging the rapists to the court, Arun realizes how difficult it is to earn justice in a system ruled by corruption. His daughter is not just denied justice, but is also humiliated in the court apart from her own neighborhood.Arun tries to live peacefully thereafter with Bhoomi but a shocking revelation hits both of them and Arun decides to break his silence, finally. Together with Bhoomi, Taj and some more people, he begins his struggle against the perpetrators and vows to not let anyone of them leave peacefully. His brutality increases with time and even goes on to win the support from law.But will the perpetrators sit silently as Arun plots his next move? Will Arun be able to survive and win this battle? Will Bhoomi turn out to be victorious in her battle?These and many other questions form the base of Bhoomi, an Indian Hindi-language action drama with revenge as its basic theme but also the love and strong relationship of a father and daughter as its strong point. The film addresses a sensitive issue with perfection, and thus is no ordinary commercial fare."
