    "plot outline": "The film begins with a 'retreat', in which alumni from different batches of a residential school have travelled to their alma mater for a reunion. Anabil, one of the alumnus, presently working with UNICEF India as a 'child protection specialist', narrates the story of his childhood days spent in the residential school. In his childhood, when he was admitted to the residential school by his parents, Anabil happened to be a very shy student possessing below average abilities. For such a child, time table specific, demanding hostel life was not easy. A mischievous senior student Bishey and his gang added to Anabil's woes. Due to similarity in names, Anabil was nicknamed 'Beelay' (the pet name of Swami Vivekananda)by his seniors. With the passage of time when it was almost certain that Anabil would fail to adapt the hostel life, a new monk arrives as the hostel-warden. The new monk 'Kanu da', by virtue of his gentle qualities becomes Anabil's inspiration. The little boy seems to have been enlightened and starts showing signs of development. At about this time, Anabil finds a magical diary that completely changes his life. As the film progresses, the secret of this mysterious diary slowly unfolds.",
