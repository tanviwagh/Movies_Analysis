Beyond a shadow of the doubt, he finds out it is a soul of a girl Amrutha (Samantha Akkineni) who is seeking answers for her death. Rudra ensures Amrutha he will definitely help her. So she starts revealing her past. Amrutha is a bright and intelligent student who has grown up with values and norms given by her father Parandhamaiah (Rao Ramesh). While out on a college excursion, somebody secretly films her nude body while bathing in the same resort and uploaded on the internet which leads to her father's death. After that Amrutha also committed suicide due to the pain which was given by the society. Now Rudra starts his investigation to catch the real culprit. At last, he cracks the mystery it was Kiran (Abhinaya) daughter of Chandra Shekar (Devan) Vice Chancellor of the Institution, who was jealous of Amrutha's popularity and the fondness of her love interest Nandu (Nandu) towards Amrutha. After learning the truth, Amrutha tries to kill Kiran but Rudra obstructs her way by remembering the morals taught by her father and makes her soul leaves happily. Finally, the movie ends with the 3 youngsters running their resort successfully with a caution that cell phones are not allowed and Rudra moving towards a new mission."
