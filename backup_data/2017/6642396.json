    "synopsis": "The father-daughter duo Saint Dr. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insan and Honeypreet Insan is back with Jattu Engineer, a comedy film based on a village, which is very backward and the villagers are very lazy, indulging in their lazy pursuits and are addicted to drugs, alcohol, and gambling. There is garbage all around and no one cares a damn. A Rajput teacher, played by Dr. MSG, tries to change this village through his own ways and noble intentions. But these villagers are in no mood to oblige.Understanding the need of bringing about a transformation by being one amongst these villagers, we have another very interesting character essayed by Dr. MSG, who ushers in a change in the entire village through delightful and funny means! The film drives home very important messages against drugs, inviting society to embrace cleanliness and work towards the fruits of hard work, which are the juiciest and tastiest."
