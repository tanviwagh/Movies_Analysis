Back at her parents' home after her husband had decided to cut her out of his life by giving her a talaq, Halim had had settled into the life of an outcast, the woman who could not keep her man.As Halim prepared herself for a solitary life, spent at the mercy of her brothers and uncles, she took comfort in the fact that at least the worst was over. What she did not know is that this was just the calm before the storm, and just as suddenly as he had left, her arrived one day at her doorstep wanting to take off from where they had left off, oblivious of what this will do to Halim's life.Halim's life is turned upside down once again, but being the only man she had ever loved she decides to forgive him on hearing that he had left her only to protect from being tortured at his mother's hands.As Halim and her husband thank god for giving them a second chance and start planning their life together their dreams come to an abrupt halt on learning that as per their religious law to marry her ex-husband Halim would first have to marry and consummate her marriage with another man.Conflicted by the love for her husband and the strict law, which stood between them, Halim finally decides to give her life with her ex-husband another chance when a Maulana agrees to help them out by marrying and divorcing her after the stipulated three month period so that she could be reunited with her ex-husband.With Halim being married off to the Maualna, while on the outside things seemed to be moving on track, for Halim a storm was brewing within, the Maulana's caring & kindness was changing for Halim the definition of love and what it is to be loved.With the talaq's moving as planned, the entire village gathers for the third talaq which will finally re-unite Halim with her ex-husband.In a world where men are taught to apologize for their weaknesses, women for their strengths, will Halim be able to stand up for herself and what she her heart truly desires?"
