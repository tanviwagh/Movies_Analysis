An unemployed youth named Vetri comes to Chennai in search of his friend Ravi, hoping to get a job under his boss Karuna who is an ex MLA. Ravi tells Vetri that as of now there is no vacancy under his boss, he is very innocent and has to learn a lot about life for that, he has to meet a person called Guru, if he is fortunate enough he will be hired by Guru. Guru is the founder of \"Art Of Theft\" (company name). Ravi's boss Karuna (ex MLA) is going to contest the elections and is very desperate to win the elections. Karuna (ex MLA) plans to bribe public for vote. Guru and his team sketch a plan to loot Karuna's money when it is transported to the distribution area. Finally Police takes over the money. The police inspector Miller and the constable start moving with the money in the jeep in order to submit it to the Election Commission of India. All of a sudden another jeep from the opposite side comes and knocks down the police jeep. The police jeep crashes, Miller and constable are thrown out and severely injured. Miller can see nothing but a blurred vision of a man taking the money bag with him. Money is looted. Who is the real thief? It is a roller coaster ride all together with witty dialogues and peppy numbers in between.",
