        "A kind-hearted person must face his OCD condition in order to win his love back.",
        "Anand is a software engineer suffering from OCD. He wants everything to be perfect and clean. Anand falls in love with Meghana, who is okay with his obsession. But things get problematic as Anand's obsession comes in the way of their love. He is thrown into a situation where he has to overcome his obsession to succeed in love.",
        "Anand (Sharwanand) is a software engineer having OCD problems. He falls in love with his office mate Meghana (Mehrene) and manages to impress her. Will the person he loves learn to live with his quirks or will he have to change is the plot.::Swatwik Thogata",
        "Story revolves around male lead (Sharwanand) of the film who suffers with OCD condition in regards of cleanliness and hygiene. He wants to be clean and expects every one around him to be so. So how he deals with his condition and manages to impress the female lead (Pirzada), whom he meets once when she is lecturing a couple of colleagues about the importance of cleanliness and thinks she is the one for him in this life, of the film while struggling to convince her family who know of his condition. While the first half is all about how Sharwanand's daily life is, how he meets Pirzada and manages to impress her and her father. Second half is where the hero goes to heroin's village on her father's (Nasser) request to be with him to solve some problems at village because of his opposition where Sharwanand will have to fight for his love and family in mud along with OCD condition. Comedy is in bits and pieces here and there, not much. Vennela Kishore did good job again as comedian. Not very far when he becomes the best comedian. Nasser being the senior member did good as usual. No doubts there. Both the leads work is good but not like impressive. I have seen Sharwanand's work in other films in which he did an excellent work but not much was extracted out of him in this film. Pirzada's expectations out of this film to have a come back may not be fulfilled yet. Some minor flaws in screen play like, how could an OCD person who doesn't touch anybody for cleanliness touches his mom and girlfriend? Overall, an okay film.::Suneel",
        "Anand (Sharwanand), a project manager in a company, suffers from OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). Meghana (Mehreen) joins his project and he immediately falls for her as she is also a neatness freak. When her father (Nasser) gets a stroke, he is reluctant to take him to hospital due to his OCD behavior. After this incident she doesn't want to see him again but her father is under impression that he was saved by Anand. Her father invites Anand to their village. Rest of the drama is about how he regains her love."
