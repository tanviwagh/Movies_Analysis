        "Set against the backdrop of the late 70s is the story of a college fresher, \"Shreyas\", who has a turbulent love life after he is dragged into a company of new friend's viz. \"Katta\" gang and others around them and later on discovers the magic of friendship and love in his college. In campus \"Shreyas\" makes friends with \"DSP\" aka \"Digya\" (Ankush Chaudhari) and others. A do-gooder standing tall for friendships in the face of a creep \"Sai\" aka \"Sainath\" (Jitendra Joshi), \"Shreyas\" becomes the voice of reason for the rustic gang. Their \"katta\" (a bench) near a tea stall is their hangout, and this is where they discuss life, love and scores to be settled. This is where \"Shreyas\" and \"Digya\" realize that \"yaari\" (friendship) is more important than duniyadari. While the seeds of this friendship are blossoming beautifully, two beautiful girls enter \"Shreyas's\" life. \"Shrin\" (Sai Tamhankar) is a medical student, who \"Shreyas\" loves and \"Meenu\" (Urmila Kanetkar) is another student in love with \"Shreyas\". \"Shreyas\" discovers the magic of love and friendship in college days. Despite expressing her feelings for \"Shreyas\", \"Shirin\" is forced to introduce \"Sainath\" as the man she will be marrying, to \"Shreyas\", who is therefore, heartbroken. \"Shirin\" with the help of her brother \"Pritam\" (Sushant Shelar) brings \"Meenu\" closer to \"Shreyas\"."
