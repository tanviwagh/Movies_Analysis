She sets off for her destination wedding with fiance, Sunny, to her ancestral property Mt. Unique Estate, only to fall helplessly in love with its stud farm keeper Devdhar. Consumed by his robust yet poetic, aggressive yet persistent advances, she realised that his arms were the ultimate destination of her dreams. But who really was Devdhar? A conman hired to destroy her bliss, a supernatural being or just a figment of her imagination? Torn between her lover and the one she dared to love, Natasha learnt that love is the deadliest deception when she engulfed herself into a vortex of devastating upheavals that left all those touched by it's intensity heart broken and in a state of bewilderment.",
