Yet his own life is in chaos after he was sentenced to prison for causing a patient's suicide. Free again, he opens a practice in a makeshift office, in a glamorous high rise no less, and sets to work, trying to get his life back on track at the same time. This means getting his wife back, fighting to keep his license to practice, protecting his teenage sister from her violent boyfriend, and, most of all, proving his innocence for the death of his former patient. Moreover he knows the identity of the killer, but proving it isn't so easy. With each case he gets closer to his goal and, although he helps his clients, brilliantly solving their seemingly impossible problems - will he be able to help himself?",
