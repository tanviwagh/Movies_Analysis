    "synopsis": "Tushar and his pregnant wife Neha, a young couple is forced to leave the city and hide in a rural village of their driver Bhaurao when Tushar was attacked and beaten by debt collectors. She discovers things are not what they seem in the village and the driver's family. They are forced to live in the farmhouse of Bhaurao's brother where the story of the late brother and his late wife slowly comes to light. It is also revealed how the deaths of those two are related to the deaths of three of Bhaurao's sons as well as the first wife of Bhaurao's fourth son. Neha slowly starts to unravel the tangled web of deceit, murder, female infanticide and traditional beliefs. There are a few plot twists along the way as well.There are only four main characters including Bhaurao's wife Tulasa. The story proceeds through flashbacks and vivid daydreams experienced by Neha as they live in the farmhouse. It begins with her meeting the three kids of Bhaurao and Tulasa. She also realizes that the fourth son was already married when he went to the city for work and married there again thus revealing him engaging in Polygamy. Meanwhile Tushar leaves Neha in the care of Tulasa despite Neha's wishes to the contrary. He goes off to the city to try and settle his financial dues with the goons from the debt collector. Neha is intrigued and at the same time mesmerized by the different behavior exhibited by Tulasa towards her son's first wife. Things finally come to a head when Neha insists on leaving the place and demands to Tushar to take her away."
