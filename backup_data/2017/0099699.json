        "George Faure is a Frenchman who has been offered a job in the U.S., but to get it he must obtain a work permit--green card--and the easiest way is to marry an American. Bronte Parrish is a New Yorker who is a keen horticulturist and has just found the perfect flat with its own greenhouse--unfortunately the flat is for married couples only. A marriage of convenience seems the ideal solution to both problems. To convince the immigration officers that they married for love, they must move in together. As the mismatched couple attempts to cope with life together, they start to fall in love.::Sami Al-Taher <staher2000@yahoo.com>"
