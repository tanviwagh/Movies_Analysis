Twelve years later, Samuel and his wife, Esther, welcomes a nun and six orphaned girls to his home. He tells that only a locked room (that belonged to Bee) and Esther's room would be off limits for the girls.

What has Janice unleashed in Bee's room?::Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",
        "Mr Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) handcrafted wooden toys and dolls. He seems very happy with his wife Esther (Miranda Otto) and their daughter, Bee (Samara Lee). That is, until Bee is quickly taken from them in a road accident. Some time later, the Mullins' open their old home to Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) and a handful of young girls from an orphanage, in particular a wheelchair/crutch-bound girl named Janice (Talitha Bateman). By this time, Mrs. Mullins has been bed-ridden with a \"condition\" and Mr. Mullins appears quiet and withdrawn. Janice doesn't do as she's told - which is to stay away from one locked bedroom - but something draws her to enter this room and look around. It's the Mullins' daughter's room. She is led by what appears to be Bee's ghost, and she finds the doll: Annabelle. Strange things start happening in the home. The young girls start experiencing things first. Janice's closest friend Linda (Lulu Wilson) is the first one to figure out what's starting to go on, speaking to Mr Mullins about it briefly. It doesn't take long for things to escalate. Linda manages to get Sister Charlotte to understand the root of the problems so far - the doll - and she confronts Mrs. Mullins. The Mullins' appear to know and understand what's going on, hinting it's been dealt with before; but it's not enough to save them all this time.::Margi_P",
