Oli, also in her 20s, goes to London from Kolkata in search of her father who had left her and the family. The story takes us through their journeys, the connections they make, and the pursuit of finding their blood relations. The Bongs Again is fun-filled but with insights which change the way we perceive life. The film depicts today's cosmo Calcuttans and NRI Bengalis, their lifestyle, thinking, and approach towards life.",
