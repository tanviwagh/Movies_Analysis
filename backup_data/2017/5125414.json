    "synopsis": "Amazon Obhijaan is an eternal saga of an explorer's quest for adventure. A story of discovery and knowledge; unrelenting courage, survival, loss & pain. But above all, it is a tale of universal human bond and connection & the wisdom an individual gains from it.The film begins in Amazon in 1913 with the shipwreck of The Witch of Endor, killing a group of Garimpeiros or Gold Hunters. A sealed bottle with an ancient coded map of El Dorado, locked in the vault, sinks into the riverbed of Rio Solimoes along with the ship. Marco Florian, an Italian adventurer, possessor of the map & the sole survivor is washed ashore at Miratinga. Attacked by a panther, Marco faints but not before witnessing his saviours, The Virgins of the Sun, the mythical women warriors of Amazon.Two year later, Marco Florian's daughter Anna, a young anthropologist, approaches the Bengali explorer Shankar Choudhury, requesting him to join for an expedition. It's a journey to the heart of Amazon, to discover the enigmatic ethnic Yanomami people & the hidden city of gold, El Dorado. Shankar who had already savoured the elation of discovery at the Richter veldts in Africa, readily accepts Anna's request.From there on the an enthralling yet long and arduous journey begins. Laden with natural difficulties, wild animals, savage tribes, and vicious gold digger, the explorers travel thousands of miles to reach the mythical city.
