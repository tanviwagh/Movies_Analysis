    "synopsis": "Carolina and Tony are driving through the torrential rain that has been falling all day. They are going to see a flat yet another flat. They have seen dozens already. Ever since they have been expecting a baby, they have been looking for something a little bigger, but the agent has told them that this flat is something a little special.First impressions are not exactly good. Like all of the properties in the area, the flat seems to have been abandoned and is totally empty and what about all the random limbs of old shop mannequins scattered across the floor, the stairs and the landingsThe estate agent re-assures them. The council is apparently refurbishing the whole area. In just a few months they are going to be sitting on a gold mine. And whats more, two new families have also just moved in. On the mezzanine and the second floor.They go up to the third floor and enter the flat. Which is something they should never have done... Their flat, the whole building in fact, is a trap. Watched over by a diabolical landlady"
