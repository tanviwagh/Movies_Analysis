A series of targeted attacks on Rocky leave the once indomitable fighter in a deep depressive, semi delusional state. The perpetrators responsible for his losses, once revealed, ignite an unimaginable wrath in him. Rocky commits to retribution in characteristic flair, all along protecting those he has still left, and those he had once cared for.",
