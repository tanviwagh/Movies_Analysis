        "A killer bandit decides to become a politician in order to avenge deaths in his family.",
        "_Rakta Charitra_ (qv) is a biographical tale of Paritala Ravi from Andhra Pradesh, a prime suspect accused in a number of murder cases. It is the story of a man's phenomenal rise to power and a story of the most intense blood curdling conflict ever heard of between two individuals. Moreover, the story is also the ultimate statement on the often heard disastrous consequences of a fatal mixture of caste, crime, family feuds and politics.::Mannu-Sadana",
        "Anandpur-based lower-caste Veerbhadra canvases support for his mentor and employer, an upper caste MLA, Narsimha Deva Reddy, much to the chagrin of other upper caste people, including Nagmani Reddy, who instigate Narsimha to such an extent that he alienates Veerbhadra, leaving Nagmani to conspire and then ultimately have the former brutally killed at the hands of his very own servant, Mandha. Veerbhadra's enraged son, Shankar, wreaks havoc within upper caste folks but the local police, who function as private security guards for upper caste Brahmans and politicians, have him killed. This prompts Veerbhadra's second son, Pratap Ravi, to return from the city and carry on the vendetta with considerable success - killing Mandha, Narsimha, and Nagmani. But Pratap's life is in danger from demoniacal Bukka, the son of Nagmani and he joins forces with movie-actor and aspiring politician, Shivaji Rao, and becomes a minister in the cabinet. After the killing of Bukka, Pratap is summoned to meet with Shivaji, and it is this meeting that will start a new chapter in Pratap's life.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
