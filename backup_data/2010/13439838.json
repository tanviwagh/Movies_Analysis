    "plot outline": "The film begins with Subbu (Ajay) killing Suruli (Sampath Ram) in Kodaikanal and he starts remembering his past. In 1992, Subbu (Yuva Karthik) was a carefree secondary school student and lived with his strict father and sawmill labourer Rasu Thevar (Radha Ravi). Jasmine who came from Madras joined his school and became his classmate, her father Williams (Devan) was a wealthy businessman. Subbu fell in love with her at first sight and he tried to woo her but Jasmine didn't reciprocate his love and she preferred to be friends with Subbu. Jasmine even helped him pass the plus two exam. At the close of the school year, Jasmine returned to Madras with her parents. Back to the present, doctors have given up their hopes on Jasmine who is now a coma patient. Her parents are left with no options other than mercy-killing her but Subbu believes that he can bring her back to normalcy and he takes her with him. In 1992, Rasu Thevar died after a workplace accident and Subbu ended up without money. Subbu decided to not go to college and he got his father's job. One day, Subbu found Jasmine's letter stating the address of her new home and he wrote love letters to his sweetheart every day for a year. In the meantime, Jasmine joined a college in Madras and Subbu's love letters were intercepted by her mother Elizabeth (Usha Elizabeth). Six years later, Jasmine, who had a decent job that paid well, returned to Kodaikanal for her holidays and she came to know about the love letters sent by Subbu. Jasmine was in shock that Subbu was still in love with her and she advised him to forget her. In the meantime, Suruli who was Subbu's enemy hit Jasmine with his car and she fell into a coma. Back to the present, Williams lodges a complaint against Subbu for taking Jasmine with him and the court orders Subbu to leave her to Williams. When Williams takes her home from him, Subbu shoots himself in the head and Jasmine finally wakes up.",
