        "When a large number of villagers die inexplicably in Andhra Pradesh, an elder predicts Bhagwan will appear to provide answers and prevent any more injustice. Shortly after taxi-driver Raju assists 5'10\" statuesque beauty, Subhasini/Sumita in the Rajasthan desert, he is attacked by a large number of goons, gets stabbed in the back, and is believed to be dead. Surprisingly, he survives, beats up the goons, performs a number of miracles, and is mistaken for Bhagwan Shri Shivji. Subhasini and he then part company as her marriage has been arranged with Babji/Bobby, the son of wealthy industrialist, G.K., while Raju sets about to find out why impoverished villagers are dying.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
