        "While on the run from the reformatory, a 12 year old boy named Municipality finds and saves a two day old abandoned baby from becoming the prey to a ferocious street dog. Failing to find any takers among the people whom he deemed responsible and respectable, Municipality takes up the onus of finding the mother of that abandoned baby himself. Municipality's rock steady determination ultimately helps him emerge a winner against all odds as he reaches that baby's mother but in bargain he loses his most precious possession, the flawless and god-like image of a mother he used to see in his dreams and probably the hope that he'll ever find his own mother again.::iDream Independent Pictures",
        "Soda, Muncipalty, Sursuri, Dhed-Shanna and Cutting are a gang of homeless petty thieves who pick pockets while polishing shoes at Mumbai Central Station. One day they pick the pocket of a wealthy male, are hunted down by the police, and Muncipalty is caught, beaten and sent to the Juvenile Center. After the Warden attempts to sexually molest him, he escapes, rescues a baby boy, and names him Krish. With the exception of Soda, the rest of the group band together to try and locate the baby's mother. All they know is that Krish was abandoned by an unknown woman who had traveled by a taxi-cab that had the poster of Bollywood movie 'Tere Naam' on it's rear window. Their attempts to locate the mother will pit these children against drug-dealers, pimps, prostitutes, baby thieves, corrupt policemen, and eunuchs - in a country where approximately 270 children are abandoned daily, for a variety of reasons, by their very own mothers.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
