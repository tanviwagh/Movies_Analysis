Roopa is told that she will never have a brother again nor will anyone dare to marry her, and that she will spend the rest of her life as Gujjar's mistress. In response Roopa throws herself down a cliff into a waterfall. She survives, meets with Kishan and Shankar, but tells them a different background story, and that her name Radha. Kishan is attracted to Roopa and both fall in love. When Kishan finds out that Radha is really Roopa, he gets upset with her. She runs away from him, back to her town, where she finds out that her mother is distraught, and her younger brother, Gopal, too has been killed by Gujjar. It is then Kishan and Shankar also enter this town, and after many discussions decide to set up a trap for Gujjar by organizing another mela.
