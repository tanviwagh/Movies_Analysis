    "plot outline": "This thought-provoking tale follows the fluctuating fortunes in the life of Viswanatha Panicker, the corrupt president of a grama panchayat. Panicker is a self-made man who has become immensely wealthy through corruption. He is called 'Pramani' because he has in his custody several documents; the Pramaanams as they call it. No prizes for guessing that these remain in his custody much against the wishes of its owners. Panicker is also called 'America' for his special interest in getting involved in other people's issues, irrespective of whether he is wanted there or not. Every man comes to a point in his life when he would have to turn a new leaf and start afresh. Into Panicker's life walks in a new Panchayat Secretary by the name of Janaki (Sneha), who makes life hell for him, as she a strict disciplinarian with no mercy for corrupt people like him. Panicker also has two other major adversaries. Castro Vareeth (Janardhanan) who is the Leftist president of a village that lies close by, and the firebrand revolutionary Mao Murugan (Suraj Venjarammood) who is a die-hard follower of Che Guevara often lock horns with the panchayat president. Amidst this tumultuous political backdrop more problems arise when Janaki and Viswanatha Panicker are accused of having an affair, with fingers being pointed at their integrity and character. Will Panicker succeed in realizing his past mistakes and redeem himself in the eyes of those who matter to him?",
