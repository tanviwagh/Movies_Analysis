He follows them but is unable to rescue her and returns home. The family seek the assistance of the police, and after a thorough investigation they inform the family that they cannot do anything - for Dipti's abductors, Diwakar and Prabhakar - are much too influential, powerful and fearless, and it is possible that she may not even be alive now. Sandeep must now make a decision about Dipti as he readies himself to travel abroad, while his relatives, who have witnessed that the wedding rituals are incomplete, urge him to get married to another girl.",
