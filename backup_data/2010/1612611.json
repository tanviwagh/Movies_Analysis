    "plot outline": "Phoonk 1 ends with the killing of Madhu, the woman who casts a black magic spell on Rajiv's daughter Raksha. Phoonk 2 begins with Madhu's ghost returning from the grave to seek revenge on the family. On bagging a new construction project, Rajiv moves with his family to a new place. Raksha and Rohan begin exploring the new place and the surroundings- the lonely beach and then the woods behind the house. The terror begins with Raksha and Rohan finding a doll in the woods and then it progresses to a series of highly traumatising experiences for the whole family. Manja, the only man whom Rajiv could turn to, meets a gruesome death at the hands of the black magic woman Madhu's ghost, who has risen from the grave to avenge her own death... to seek vengeance on Rajiv, by torturing his loved ones- his wife Arati and their children, Raksha and Rohan in unimaginably cruel ways. Phoonk 2 captures the fear of a family caught hostage to a murderous, animalistic spirit seeking revenge by brutally terrorizing them. We experience a fear far larger than that of a live evil than when the dead returns to haunt you. It is the fear where every escape route of yours becomes dangerously anticipated and cunningly laid out in front of you. It is the fear that extends to letting go of one loved one to save another. Where every situation takes a sinister turn for the worse, methodically murdering everyone's hope to live. Terrorized by the demonic force, will Rajiv give in to the ghost or will he betray his family and give up? Will the family survive as the gruesome and repulsing murders are committed, or do the disfigured bodies, visions, ghostly voices, and unsettling, disturbing incidents drive them to death? Will the ghost live with them till they become ghosts themselves? The choice that Rajiv has to make in the final moments of the film forms a very unsettling and a highly disturbing climax.",

        "After Raksha recovers fully from her traumatic experience, her father, Rajiv, accompanied by her brother, Rohan; mother, Arati; and maid, Laxmi, take a vacation near Ali Baug where they have a bungalow to themselves. Things go well until Raksha finds a doll in the woods and then Rohan starts to hallucinate that it is alive. Rajiv has it disposed off, and things quickly settle down - but not for long - as this time Arati complains that she is hearing voices, and Rajiv asks her to relax. They are soon joined by Rajiv's U.S.-based sister, Arushi, and her husband, Ranjeet, and the family continue to relax and enjoy themselves. Their idyllic vacation will soon be shattered when Arati will be possessed by a vengeful Madhu (a former associate of Rajiv's) - who is determined to slowly and painfully kill everyone.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
