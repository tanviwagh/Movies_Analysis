Hoping to pacify his family with his income-tax refund, he will instead be compelled to give up its entire amount after his Meerut-based sister Urmi invites them over to a wedding. He borrows a car from a neighbor, Farooqui, and, after a rather dramatic trip, is forced to compensate him as the car gets damaged. Unable to bear taunts that he cannot afford a car, he decides to buy one. It is this decision that will force Payal to seek employment in a call center. Sandeep will confess that he has been gambling, which leaves Santosh with no alternative but to consider accepting bribes from students and risk being exposed on live TV.",
