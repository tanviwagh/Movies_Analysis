        "Vikram K. Jaiswal misses his flight to Goa and but decides to travel by car to finalize a lucrative deal with a businessman who is departing for London the next day. On the Goa-Mumbai Highway he comes across an unoccupied vehicle, and checks to see if anyone is around, opens the door, sees a bag containing cash with blood-stains. He hesitantly picks it up, and drives away, and as soon as he does so some gun-toting men fire at him. Injured he manages to drive part of the way, and a male named Hiten Sardesai comes to his rescue. Vikram does not know that there are two corrupt police officers, as well as three gangsters who will do anything to procure this bag - at any and all costs.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
