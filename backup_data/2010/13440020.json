    "plot outline": "In a village, Seetha (Shraddha) hails from a middle-class Brahmin family. She lives with her parents Seenu (Delhi Ganesh) and Mangalam (Rajyalakshmi), aunt (Anjali Devi), and cousin Ramu (Vishnupriyan). Ramu is a jobless and naive young man who is madly in love with Seetha since childhood. Seenu promised Ramu that he will marry Seetha. Seetha then gets admission in a college in Chennai. In the meantime, Seetha's family is in deep debt and is under pressure from the local shark Aadhi (Munnar Ramesh) to clear their debts. In Chennai, Seetha befriends the modern girl Suzan (Ruksha), while her classmate Chakravarthy (Shravan) falls in love with her. One day, Chakravarthy makes fun of Ramu, and an angry Seetha slaps him in return. She tells Chakravarthy that she loves Ramu more than anything and will marry him. Later, a vengeful Chakravarthy abducts the lovers, and with his henchmen, beats Ramu up. A heavily wounded Ramu is rushed to the hospital and the doctors, ask for a huge amount of money to save his life. Seetha first files a complaint against Chakravarthy. A desperate Seetha then goes to Suzan's house to seek help, but Suzan's mother (S. Bhuvaneswari) drugs Seetha, and she is raped in her sleep. Thereafter, Ramu is saved, but Suzan's mother forces Seetha to come home. Chakravarthy reveals that he is the one who raped her and it was his master plan to take revenge on her. With his influence, Chakravarthy makes the innocent Seetha get arrested for prostitution. The news of Seetha being arrested for prostitution spreads like fire; thus, it tarnished the reputation of her family, and her family committed suicide. When the police come to know that Seetha is innocent, they release her without delay. When Ramu and Seetha try to leave the village to live together, Chakravarthy stops their car and attempts to kill them. During the fight, Ramu is killed by Chakravarthy, and Seetha kills Chakravarthy in turn. The film ends with Seetha committing suicide by jumping off a waterfall with Ramu's body.",
