One day, Arjun is forced to come to his native village in Karaikudi to ensure that his ancestral property is not sold. Also Anu too is forced to come to Madurai to meet her father who is injured in an accident. The two strangers meet in a train. There begins their journey towards their respective destinations. Meanwhile, a diary of Arjun's father pops out from his bag. He browses through it to understand his dad's love life. In flashback, the movie goes back to 1985. It is revealed that Sekar (Arya) returns to his village after getting selected as a Police. He falls in love with Meena (Preetika). But when their romance is revealed, Sekar's family resists the relationship due to class differences. A dejected Sekar leaves to begin training as a police officer. There he becomes acquainted with Ammaiappan (Anoop kumar), a young colleague. He comes to know that Ammayappan is in love with his uncle's daughter. A sequence of events reveals that both men love the same girl Meena. Returning to the film's contemporary setting, we find that Arjun and Anu after crossing several hurdles in their journey reach their respective houses. They then realise that they have fallen for each other. Meanwhile, the film employs a Deus Ex Machina, in the form of Anu's father, to ensure all story arcs are resolved. When Anu's father Ammaiappan realiases that Anu is in love with Sekar's son he immediately approves of their relationship. It is implied that Anu and Arjun are then to stay together.",

        "Arjun (Arya) is a DJ for a radio station in London, who is sent to India to handle an urgent family matter -- the house in which his father grew up is being put up for sale by his relatives and he has to recover it at any cost. On his way to his hometown in Karaikudi, he runs into Anu (Shriya), an MBA student also from London who is travelling to Madurai to see her ailing father, after their flight gets cancelled. Naturally, love blossoms but there is also a parallel track that shows the love story of Arjun's father."
