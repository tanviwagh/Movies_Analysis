    "plot outline": "In the village Tittakudi, Velu was a bad student at school and a hardcore fan of actor Rajinikanth, but his father did not want him to give him money to watch films; thus, he dropped out of school. Under the guidance of the workman Ramaswamy (Munnar Ramesh) and archenemy of his father, he became a construction worker against his father's will. With the money obtained from his hard work, he went to watch his favourite star's films. Many years later, Velu (Ravi) and his friend Kulanji (R. Sivakumar) have become wastrels: they drink alcohol and have sex with prostitutes. When the village girl Kalaiselvi (Aswatha), the daughter of Ramaswamy, attained puberty, Velu falls under her spell and tries to woo her. She eventually falls in love with him. Ramaswamy wants his relative Durai to marry his daughter and decides to arrange their wedding, but Kalaiselvi does not want to wed him. Thereafter, Velu sleeps with Kalaiselvi and gives her money for the service. Kalaiselvi is astonished for being in love with a cold-hearted man. A villager witnesses it, the news is spread like wildfire, and people begin to talk ill about them. Ramaswamy complains to the police that Velu raped his daughter, and Velu is arrested. At the police, Kalaiselvi confesses that it was a consensual act; therefore, Velu is released from jail. Fearing of losing her daughter, Kalaiselvi's mother makes her leave the village. Meanwhile, Ramaswamy's relatives plan to kill Velu. Kalaiselvi starts working in a cotton factory in a remote village, whereas Velu realises his mistakes. Velu tries to compromise with Ramaswamy and asks him to marry his daughter, and Ramaswamy surprisingly accepts. The day of the marriage, Velu's father drinks poison to stop it, and Velu could not attend his marriage. Ramaswamy then forces Kalaiselvi to marry a drunkard. In addition to that, Velu's family rejects him; hence, Velu becomes depressed and kills himself.",
