    "plot outline": "In a small village in Madurai, Ishvar (Ishvar) is a hard-boiled money lender who hangs up with his sidekick Oli Shankar (Singampuli) and Ishvar lives in a luxurious bungalow with his mother. Ishvar is eagerly awaiting the release of his father (Nassar) who is in jail for murder and his family is highly respected by the villagers. One day, the law student Archana (Vidya Pradeep), daughter of the village postman Rangarajan (Bala Singh), comes to the village. Each encounter between Ishvar and Archana ends up in a quarrel but they eventually fall in love with each other. When Rangarajan falls sick, Archana is forced to do her father's job while Ishvar stops lending money and opens a pawn shop. In the meantime, Ishvar helps his friend Arun to marry his lover Kanaka. Kanaka was brought up by her aunt and uncle who want to appropriate her inheritance. Meanwhile, Ishvar's father returns from jail. Arun is then killed by Kanaka's family with the help of the corrupt Sub-Inspector Muttaiah (Cheran Raj) and a shocked Archana witnesses it. Kanaka's family abducts Kanaka and forces her to give them her inheritance. Archana then reveals everything to Ishvar and a vengeful Ishvar saves Kanaka. Thereafter, some goons kill Archana in her house and stage the murder to look like suicide by hanging. Overwhelmed by his lover's death, Ishvar becomes mentally ill.",
