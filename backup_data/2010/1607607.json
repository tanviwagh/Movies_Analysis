    "plot outline": "Girls have dreams - dreams of a fairytale romance, of prince charming sweeping them off their feet, a dream wedding and living happily ever-after. Mitali, a successful model, also had dreams... Then one day she met Karan, the Mittal scion, the heir to one of the richest families in the country. Mitali 's simple, middle-class upbringing is in complete contrast to Karan's super-brat lifestyle. But Karan was smitten by Mitali. Accustomed to getting what he wants in life, Karan landed up at Mitali's home with his parents with a marriage proposal. Delighted at their daughter's luck, Mitali's family approved of the match. And Mitali entered Karan's home and life as his newly-wedded bride. It was not long before Mitali's dreams turned into her worst nightmare. Her mother-in-law detested her and created misunderstandings between Karan and her. Karan turned out to be a puppet in his mother's hands and her father-in-law is a helpless, mute spectator. Karan has a certain pattern of dealing with women and wanted to subdue Mitali's independent streak. He who appeared to be a loving husband was in fact a violent monster at night within the privacy of their bedroom.Unable to bear the humiliation and pain after she resisted his advances and is raped by him,Mitali decided to take charge of her life. She decided to fight back.Mitali walked out of her in-laws home, hired a lawyer and filed a case against her husband. Karan retaliated by hiring the best lawyer money can buy to fight on his behalf. Mittal Vs Mittal is about to he heard in court. It is a case on file that fights for the rights of women like Mitali who are subjugated to domestic violence and inhuman treatment at the hands of husband and in-laws. It is a case that will empower women to fight for their pride, respect and their very right to live with dignity. It is Mitali Mittal versus Karan Mittal...",
