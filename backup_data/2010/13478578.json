    "plot outline": "Police Inspector Mithran (Kishore) makes money on the side by hiring jobless youngsters in the area. The jobless Vinoth (Mahesh Raja), also known as Koni, along with his friends, indulges in criminal activities like extortion and rowdyism to fill the pocket of the corrupt cop Mithran. Despite his penchant for money, Mithran has a soft side: he cherishes his wife Ramya (Devi Kiruba) more than anything. Regarding Vinoth, he enjoys drinking and spending time in brothels. He is cruel even to his mother Saraswathi (Saranya Ponvannan), whom he beats up, ill-treats, cheats, and robs. Vinoth then falls under the spell of the college student Nivedha (Udhayathara). He woos her in an unusual fashion, and surprisingly, Nivedha slowly falls for him too. The youngster Pazham (Manikandan) is also part of Mithran's team. He hates Vinoth and can do anything for money. Mithran then played a double game: he assigned Vinoth with the task of killing the local don Bobby (Ponnambalam). However, Mithran himself warns Bobby about it. Bobby tries to stab Vinoth from behind, but Vinoth shoots Bobby dead. One day, during a fight with other goons, Vinoth throws a glass bottle towards his offender, but it lands on his mother Saraswathi. The bottle cuts her throat, and she dies on the spot. Distraught by the loss of his mother, Vinoth feels remorseful and finally understands the value of his mother. Mithran assigned Pazham to kill the police commissioner, but he botched the mission, and Mithran gives refuge to Pazham in his home. Pazham, who was sexually aroused by Ramya, brutally rapes her and escapes from the place. A vengeful Mithran tracks Pazham down and kills him. The police are ordered to encounter all the rowdies in the area, including Vinoth, and they shot all the rowdies. Mithran decides to kill Vinoth, but Vinoth murders him after a lengthy fight.",
