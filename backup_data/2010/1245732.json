        "While delivering food in a forest area in Andhra Pradesh, impoverished cook, Narasimha (Sunil Shetty), is abducted and held against his will by a band of Naxalites led by Velu (Ashish Vidyarthi), and forced to join them.

        "In a country aiming for super power status, the lush green lands betray a spatter of blood when viewed closely. Narsimha, a simple farm labourer, looking for funds for his kids' education, finds himself trapped in the local Naxalite movement, that is ironically fighting for the rights of the downtrodden. On one side he finds their theories right, on the other hand the law appears to be right in their stand. If both warring factions are right, then what went wrong? That's the question the film raises as it traces the journey of one man and how he evolves from a revolutionary experience.::Anonymous",
        "This movie is based on a true story of events. The moral struggle that the main protagonist faces in this movie is something the multitudes of Indians can well identify with. On the one hand is the corrupt government and police force, while on the other, it has to contend with the correctness of what armed guerillas are trying to do to cause upliftment of the poorest of the poor.::Taher K"
