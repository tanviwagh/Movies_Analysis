Shortly thereafter a male comes on the phone and informs her that Ahana is in the mental asylum after being arrested for killing her husband, Ravi, and sister-in-law, Nishita. Anushka's mother had not approved of her daughter marrying resort-owner, Ravi, and as a result they had not spoken to each other for many years. Anushka, however, departs for Goa and meets with the investigating CBI Officer, Ranvir, but is unable to see nor speak with Ahana who has apparently disappeared. Her investigations will pit her against an unknown entity from the Warda residence, and will entrap her in a horrific nightmarish world from which there is no escape.",
