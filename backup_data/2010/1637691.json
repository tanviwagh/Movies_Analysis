Since there is no other ground, they decide to approach widower school-master Surjya Sen, and join his band of freedom fighters. Since Gandhi had announced a ban of violence for one year, Surjya patiently waits, then raises Rs.18000/-, with this amount he procures guns, four vehicles and 25 bicycles, and inducts two women, Pritilata, and Kalpana Dutta in his team. Their plan is to surprise the British by disabling telecommunications and transportation, liberating jailed comrades, taking guns and ammunition from the armory, and holding Britishers hostage at the European Club. Before they could carry out their plan, both women are instructed by their respective families to re-locate to Calcutta. Surjya, nevertheless decides to simultaneously carry out the attacks but his group is unable to hold any hostages due to the holiday of Good Friday, and the raid on the armory gets them rifles but no ammunition. They do succeed in cutting off communications and transportation, however, the British do recover and devise plans to capture the group. With no food nor shelter, little or no ammunition, how long will Surjya and his group elude the determined British?",
