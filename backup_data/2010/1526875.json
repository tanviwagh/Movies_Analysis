        "Raghuram and his wife Anu have one daughter, Abhi. They are a lovable family, financially comfortable, facing no health or other major problems. But Raghuram loves his daughter so much that he is obsessed with trying to guide her every little step. Thus as Abhi grows, Raghuram must himself \"grow\" and gradually learn -- with comic results -- how to trust his daughter to live her own life.::sshogben",
