    "plot outline": "In a remote village, Saravanan (Rathan Mouli) is a nothing-for-good youngster living with his mother Veeramma. When he was a kid, his father left them to marry his former lover Bhagyam. The landlord Sadasivam runs in the panchayat election and his brother Aadhi tries his best to make him win and even bribes the voters. On the other hand, Saravanan and his friends support the do-gooder Shangugam for the election and Shangugam wins it by a big margin. After this humiliation, Saravanan becomes Aadhi's archenemy and Aadhi vows to take revenge. Sindhu (Sushma) arrives at the village as the new school teacher and Saravanan helps her to settle down in the village. The villagers then start to talk bad about their relationship. Meanwhile, Aadhi gets engaged to the village belle Vaidehi (Anjali Nair). One day, Saravanan takes the feverish Sindhu by cycle to the hospital and he then drops her at home but he forgets to give her medicines and Sindhu tries to catch him. The night, Saravanan drinks alcohol with his friends. The next day, a drunk Saravanan is found near the dead body of Sindhu and he is arrested by the police. Later, Aadhi reveals to his friends that he had raped Sindhu that night. Vaidehi and her father who have listened to his conversation testify against Aadhi, hence Saravanan is released from jail and Aadhi is arrested. Thereafter, Saravanan and Vaidehi fall in love with each other and they eventually get engaged. In the meantime, Saravanan and his mother reconcile with his father, his stepmother and his stepsister. Aadhi who gets released on bail rapes Vaidehi in a remote place and kills her by stoning her. The film ends with Saravanan killing Aadhi and mourning the death of his lover.",
