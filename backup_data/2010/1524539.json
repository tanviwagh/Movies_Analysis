        "Dadasaheb Phalke in an effort to escape from an acquaintance, accidentally stumbles upon cinema and is eventually smitten by it. He shares his passion for cinema with his endearing family, wife and 2 sons who are equally attracted to cinema. Much to the ridicule of the his surrounding society, this fascination of his drives him to learn the making of motion picture, culminating with a visit to London. He eventually sells almost all of his material possessions in his strife to make India's first motion picture.::PipingHotViews"
