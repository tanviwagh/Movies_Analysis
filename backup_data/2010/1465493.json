        "Based in London, England, alcoholic photographer, Armaan Suri, spends nights on a bench on a railway station, and is unable to sleep alone in his apartment as he keeps on hearing voices. He has a girlfriend, Gehna Sinha, who he wants to marry - much to the chagrin of her wealthy father. Gehna will soon be compelled to change her mind about Armaan when she sees him in the arms of his colleague, Mini. Her resolve will gather strength when he refuses treatment for hearing voices, and speaking with people only he can see.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
