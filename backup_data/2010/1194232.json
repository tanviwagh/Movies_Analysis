        "Rajesh Parekh, a simple Gujarati boy who's been looking for love since he was a baby. Thoroughly unsuccessful in his endeavors, he nearly gives up till he meets Natasha, the girl of his dreams. Desh is the youngest superstar in the country. Mothers want to adopt him and their daughters want to marry him. But when will he find the girl of his dreams? All of their worlds turn upside down when Tara an alien from Venus, lands on Earth in the search of true love.::Pragati Mehra",
        "Rejected by females since his birth, Mumbai-based Rajesh Parekh works as a clap-boy with Bollywood film-maker Farah Khan, and lives a wealthy lifestyle with his father, Ramnikbhai, and mother, Sushila. The country is agog with the popularity of Farah's latest mega-star, Desh, who has a huge female fan following. Rajesh meets and is attracted to Desh's sister, Natasha, but ends up with heartbreak when she rejects him. While watching a movie in a drive-in theater, a gorgeous amazon lands in his arms, and passes out. He takes her home, confides in his friend, Kaushal Milan Tiwari, and attempts to find out who she is. The mystery increases when she communicates that she is from Venus, and is on Earth to find true love. They decide to name her Tara, and show her photos of two of the hottest males on Earth - Brad Pitt and Desh. Since the former is already taken, and the latter single, they decide to try and woo him. But will a ego-stricken actor, who has thousands of gorgeous women willing to do his bidding, fall for an alien?::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
