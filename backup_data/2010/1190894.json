        "Aatma and his son, Vishnu, attempts to create a market for the former's hair-oil turn out to be in vain, and the latter decides to take a 1942 antique truck, that was at one time a mobile cinema-house, to a museum. He stops at a Dhabha, and decides to let the waiter, a young boy, ride with him. On the latter's insistence, he increases the speed, and the vehicle breaks down in the Rajasthani desert. The boy sets out and returns with a mechanic, Om, who fixes it and asks to be taken along. Enroute, they are stopped by the police and held until and unless they play some movies for them as well as some villagers. Om and Vishnu manage to play quite a few Bollywood movies overnight. After a dramatic reunion, they run out of water, are assisted by a wondering woman, who has never seen a movie before, and permit her to also ride with them while Om gives directions to a mythical fair. The foursome do not realize that soon they will be not only be compelled to set up a fair on their own - but also be abducted by ruthless water bandits.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
