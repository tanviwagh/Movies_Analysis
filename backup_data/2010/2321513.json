        "Madhukar Rane is a single dad with two kids - Shrinivas and Durga. Shrinivas, while very bad at studies, is an aspiring cricketer; but, like other parents, Madhukar wants him to be bright in his mark sheet and not in sports. This creates a lot of tension between father and son. One day Madhukar shoves Shrinivas in anger, whereby Shrinivas hits his head and falls into a coma. Madhukar deeply repents his mistake - even to accuse the education system of putting too much pressure on today's youth - and tries all possible ways for Shrinivas to get treatment. Finally he gets a ray of hope when a foreign base doctor handles Shrinivas' case and assures him that he will be all right.::alex.mjacko@gmail.com"
