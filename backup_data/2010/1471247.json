        "A simple story of a God fearing, devout Muslim mechanic named Hasmat Ullah who has been entrusted the job of repairing an old V8 ford engine, not knowing the historic significance that it once carried the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi which were immersed in the holy river Sangam. He is caught in a complex situation after a powerful bomb explosion rocks his town leading to the arrest of innocent Muslim youths of his locality.

        "In modern day India, a Bank Manager in Orissa finds one of 20 urns containing the last remains of Mahatma Gandhi. While the rest of the urns were immersed in holy rivers all over India during 1948, efforts are now underway to restore an antique V8 Ford Engine to transport this urn at the hands of Gandhi's great grandson, Tushar, at Sangam in Allahabad. The task is given to experienced mechanic, Hashmatullah, the owner of Hindustan Engineering Works. He not only sets about this task with the help of his son and employees but also participates in a protest after witnessing police brutality and fake arrests following a bomb explosion on board a train over the Kaveri River bridge. Then the nephew of local leader, Mohammad Ali Kasuri, is killed and a decree to close all establishments is made by Maulana Abdul Qureshi. Hashmatullah knows that if he decides to participate in this protest he will be unable to restore the truck, while fully being aware that the remains are those of a male who had attempted to lead a foot-march to newly formed Pakistan to compensate Muslims who had fled there, and had ended up being killed by a right-winged Hindu. It is not a secret that with the immersion of Gandhiji's remains truth and righteousness also vanished from Hindustan. He knows that if he persists in restoring this engine he will not only be alienated by his very own friends and the community in general - but the Maulana and Kasuri will not hesitate to even prosecute him.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
