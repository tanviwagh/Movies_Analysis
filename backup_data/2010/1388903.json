        "A story-writer attempts to convince a producer to accept four erotic stories from the Panchtantra.",
        "Maanav is a struggling filmmaker who does not want to compromise on his script. His girlfriend Ruchi is a successful film editor who arranges for him to meet Nitin, a producer. Nitin likes the script but is not very sure of its box office potential. Maanav then suggests a story from the Panchtantra: A woman is caught red-handed with her lover by her husband and yet, she manages to wriggle out of it Scot-free!

Maanav then creates three more stories based on the same premise: in a way, the Panchantra story travels in different versions to the modern times through the film. The four stories are woven together by a common story. _Mirch_ (qv) itself echoes this structure, with four stories mingling with the main narrative.::Mannu-Sadana",
        "Mumbai-based Maanav is disappointed when film producer Nitin rejects his story, and asks him to write an erotic one. Maanav decides to adapt some stories from the Panchtantra - tales from ancient India - written at a time when no subject was taboo. He narrates a story about Kashi and his seductive and seemingly faithful wife, Maya; as well as of naive, and elderly Raja Nirgun Singh and his younger wife, Lavni. Nitin appears disappointed and asks him to write about life during the 21st century. Accordingly, Maanav includes a tale about Manjula and her suspicious husband, Manjul; and of a parsimonious Sindhi married male, Asu Hotmal, who seeks sexual intimacy from a prostitute in a hotel room. Maanav will face another challenge when Nitin will ask him to include a common link between the four short stories.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
