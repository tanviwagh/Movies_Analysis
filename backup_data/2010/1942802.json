    "plot outline": "Nandu (Sarwanand), a village youth who works in a city, is altruistic. His colleague, Paddu (Padma Priya), is a composed girl, who is particular about spending each and every rupee for her own good. Yet, both are surprised at each others' attitude towards philanthropy, and still being friends. Paddu slowly falls in love with Nandu for all his nobility. A situation so develops that Nandu pledges his eyes and heart for a loan of Rs 5 lakh, which he distributes for public good. When the money lender, who happens to be a goon, arrives to claim the heart and eyes of Nandu (as he fails to repay the loan), what happens? It forms the crux of the story. As the film touches the sidelined in society and yet perennial topics inside the man like money, sex and selfishness, there is a possibility that it could tickle the senses of the youth. Watching this movie will not bring any disappointment to the audience, though it has the A certification.",
