        "Children narrate the story of the Parekh family, who at first humiliate Buddhidev; and then attempt to fulfill a deceased Chandrakant Tribhuvandas Seth's last wish to get a bride for his naive son, Himanshu. Their attempts to find one result in nothing but heartbreak for the prospective groom as he not only gets rejected but also humiliated. He does get to meet his sweetheart, Parminder Kaur, their neighbor, who lives with scores of other male/female 'Parminders' - who dislikes Bollywood actors - and accept Himashu with open arms. After his engagement, Himanshu plots with the rest of the family and decides to create a rift between the Singhs and the Parekhs in order to immortalize his romance. After failing to make them hate him for trying to become a Bollywood actor, he sets off trying to alienate them. He does succeed, so much so that the Singhs not only cancel the wedding but also decide to get Parminder married to a male - also named Parminder - while a beleaguered Himanshu gets arrested and charged with attempting to kill their friend, Chakku Singh Ahluwalia.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)",
        "More funny than a circus and more deadly than a mob, Parekh family is back, this time on the big screen. This time, they are out on an adventure which will threaten the safety of every family in the country, maybe even the world, in the most hilarious possible manner: They are out to fulfill Himanshu's dream of making a real-life legendary love story of the same scale as Romeo And Juliet, DDLJ and Maine Pyar Kiya. And as the story progresses, the Parekhs are going to find a match of their own in the Parminder family. And problem isn't Himanshu will have to make himself acceptable to the Parminders, problem is they have already accepted him. The Parekhs must now race against time to ruin the wedding, create misunderstandings, then dramatically fight for justice for Himanshu and ensure a happy ending, leaving behind a trail innocent people traumatized by their encounters with Praful's antiques, Hansa's stupidity, Jayshree's cleverness, Babuji's angry yellings and of course Himanshu's very foolishness which made Parminder fall in love with him for no reason.::ankit-singh92"
