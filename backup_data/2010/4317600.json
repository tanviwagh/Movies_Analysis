    "plot outline": "15 years after an accident in which Bala's parents both died, Bala returns with wife, Revathi, and son, Anand, to his hometown. They decide to stay a couple of nights in the massive house that he grew up in. As he spends a few days in the house and recalls his memories, Anand- who has a disability to speak- sees movement around the house. But he cannot tell anyone what he witnesses. Soon Revathi who suffers from claustrophobia, sees that the house is haunted and so tells Bala that they have to go back to Chennai. Anand enjoys being in the presence of the ghosts and doesn't find any problem. Problems come up between the couple that they had never thought of when they had love marriage. Soon Revathi discovers that they did not come on holiday but in fact, came to escape some rowdies that Bala owes money to. This is when Bala's classmate and business partner, Jeeva, arrives to stay with them. His company had borrowed 40 lakhs from a rowdy and over the months it had increased to 50 lakhs but he is unable to pay back any money as his agent, who was supposed to give him 2 crores, runs away and is nowhere to be found. With the help of ghosts, Bala and his family find a way to escape from being kept under house arrest.",
