Tej and Vakil accordingly travel to Punjab, meet Samarpreet and her family, and the couple get married. Tej returns to Trinidad, mails a cheque every month, refuses to communicate with her, and continues with his lifestyle as though he was never married. He is friendly with a supermodel, Shimmer Canhai, and through her meets a young woman, Sammar Capore, and instantly falls in love with her. He accepts a bet with Shimmer that he will successfully woo and wed Sammar but is in for disappointment when she prefers the company of a male named Jigar. Tej sets out to ruin Jigar's career.",
