Despite all the attention he gets from the fairer sex, Surya's heart beats only for Nanditha (Sanjana). The loved-up couple enjoy life to the fullest, with the blessings of their families as well. But just as they decide to take their relationship to the next level, their engagement is called off when Nanditha learns about Surya's other affairs. In the second half of the film, the plot takes a twist when it is revealed that Surya's childhood sweetheart Bhargavi had died under mysterious circumstances. Will Nanditha be able to overlook Surya's past and reconcile with him? This pretty much sums up the rest of the narrative.",
