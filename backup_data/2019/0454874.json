He follows her secretly to a casino. There he finds out that Theresa is a gambling addict. Later he even witnesses Theresa going to a hotel with a stranger who payed for her debts in the casino. Morten and Theresa argue and separate. But only a day later Theresa comes back and asks him for help. She promises to stop gambling. While Morten changes his own life and emancipates himself from his parents, it seems that Theresa never will be able to overcome her addiction.",
