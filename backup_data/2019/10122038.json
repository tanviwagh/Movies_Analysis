        "Films about the prevalent system that are told without filters are barely any in Kannada and this sets the film apart. The film does have that little trigger that acts as a catalyst in making you feel uneasy about the world around you.",
        "Subhash is a young and dynamic IAS officer, His relentless and uncompromising way of working sends shivers across the corridors of power, cutting across political and business circles. Being incorruptible and principled, his idealism and righteousness soon become a threat to the entire system.",
        "Subhash is an IAS officer who is posted as the district commissioner in the Karnataka region. Through his strong vigil and courage, he becomes a threat to the entire corrupt system and the officials involved. As the corrupt officials team up to take him down, Subash must call upon every bit of fight inside him to deliver justice to the people.::Shrinivas G. Kulkarni"
