    "plot outline": "This story revolves around Abhimanyu, the son of a Multibillionaire, who's passion is Music. This fact does not sit well with his father, who wants him to take over their family business instead. A heated argument-in which his father emphasises the importance of culture, hoping that at least this will help Abhimanyu get somewhere in life- leads to Abhimanyu leaving his house in Mumbai to go to Kolkata in order to prove himself to his father; to prove that even though their roots may be in Kolkata, culture lies in their heart. In Kolkata, Abhimanyu faces character- defining obstacles and eventually falls in love with Shrabonti( who, he had initially known due to them attending college together in Mumbai).",
