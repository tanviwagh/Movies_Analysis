        "Adi, a man who constantly hustles to make things happen, is tasked with finding a fakir - a holy man, known for performing feats of endurance. Instead he finds Sattar, a poor man who buries himself in sand on the beach to collect money from passersby and tourists. Together, the two con men venture to Venice where the fakir is to be featured in an art exhibit. Once in the ancient city, their paths diverge. Adi seizes upon the opportunity to advance in the world while Sattar, under the constant gaze of mystified spectators and the foreignness of Italy grows homesick and increasingly isolated. In a strange land where their culture is commodified and exploited for artistic, political and spiritual purposes, these two men are forced to examine the course of their individual lives."
