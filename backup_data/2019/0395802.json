        "Orphaned and abandoned at birth, Ajay has a very cynical view of the world and is unable to secure employment. He does find work at a hospital but is angered at the manner in which the doctors and staff treat corpses, often releasing them to the next of kin for a price, and his protests get him fired. He gambles in order to get money so that his friend, Shlok, can get married to wealthy Pooja. His guardian, Havaldar, finds out about his gambling bout, which has angered local gangsters, beats him severely and asks him to leave. Homeless, poor, hungry and with angry goons on his tail, Ajay has virtually nowhere to run and will soon realize that his time is running out.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
