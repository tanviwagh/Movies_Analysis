        "Balbir Chaudhary is a well-to-do businessman living with his mother and children Babloo and Sweety in small-town Moga in Punjab. Sahil Mirza, son of a well-known producer, is a failed writer/director. He saves Sweety from a person but later realizes that it was her brother Babloo trying to stop her for something. Sahil reaches Moga with Chatro to search for Sweety and conducts an acting workshop. Baldev and his family think that Sweety is having an affair with a Muslim boy and set boundaries for her in the outside world. Sahil inspires Sweety's grandmother and is invited to her birthday party with Chatro where Baldev mistakes him as the same Muslim boy. All the while Sahil thinks that Sweety is in love with him, but she discloses to him that she is different from everyone and tells her secret.::alex.mjacko@gmail.com"
