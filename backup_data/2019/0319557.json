    "plot outline": "Since 1965 bitter hatred and animosity has reigned between two families, namely that of Indrasen's and the Reddys, which results in the death of Indrasen's dad, and his two uncles, one of whom was killed by none other than his very own newly wedded wife from the Reddy family. Veer Shiva is arrested, found guilty and imprisoned. When he is discharged, he challenges Indrasen and gets killed. His five sons swear on his funeral pyre to avenge his death. Then their sister, Snehlata, returns from the U.S., is attracted to Indrasen and wants to marry him, much to the displeasure of her brothers, especially Veer Shankar, who would rather kill his son than be obliged to Indrasen for saving his life. While negotiating with the Reddys for some land to build a water reservoir, Indrasen ends up forfeiting his property, estate, and also making a commitment to marry Snehlata. On the day of the wedding Snehlata goes to the temple for prayers, and it is there that she it told that Indrasen has gone on a rampage, killing three of her brothers. Watch what happens when Snehlata joins forces with Shiva to avenge the death of her brothers.",
