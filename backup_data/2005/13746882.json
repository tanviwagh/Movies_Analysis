Many years later, Shanmugam's son Sakthivel (Trivikram) is a bright student who obtains a master's degree with distinction. Shanmugam wants his son to become an IPS officer.

Meanwhile, Kavitha's uncle Karuppusamy (Ramesh Kanna), a nothing-for-good, wants to marry Kavitha at any cost. Sakthivel and Kavitha get engaged, and Sakthivel then leaves the village to attend the IPS interview in Delhi. The day of the wedding, Sakthivel returns to the village and announces that he did not attend the interview.
