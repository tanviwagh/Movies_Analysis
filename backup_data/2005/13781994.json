    "plot outline": "For misinterpreting a friendly relationship with a girl to be a love affair, the college student Santhosh (Santhosh) gets a punishment from the court: to read Mahatma Gandhi's autobiography for a week in the Mother Teresa's library. A few months later, Santhosh joins a college in Chennai. Nithika (Srisha), a studious student and a social worker, is attracted by his attitude and she falls in love with him. Santhosh likes her too but he has only one thing in mind: having sex with her. They fall in love with each other and start dating each other. One day, Santhosh tries to have sex with Nithika in his home but Nithika, who strongly believes that premarital sex is taboo, insults him and runs away. A few months ago, Santhosh was a dedicated student in Coimbatore, he had the ambition to study aeronautics and to become a pilot. He and his collegemate Subha (Ashwini) fell in love with each other. One day, Subha wanted to have sex with him but he refused. He explained to her that love should be pure and sex should be only after the marriage. For his love, he made several sacrifices including not going to an aeronautics training. Thereafter, Subha announced to him that she will marry a wealthy NRI and explained that their love wasn't strong enough (because they didn't have sexual intercourse). He created a ruckus at the registrar's office and Subha lied by saying that they were just friends. The police then arrested Santhosh hence the punishment to read Mahatma Gandhi's autobiography. Back to the present, Santhosh tries to reconcile with Nithika but she tells him that he is \"unfit\" for love. Santhosh then meets Subha, she tells him that her husband divorced her when she got breast cancer. She apologizes to him for her mistakes and she is now working in an ashram. Santhosh and Nithika finally understand their feelings, and they make up after their quarrel.",
