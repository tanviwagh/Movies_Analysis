But Senthilnathan falls in love with Ganga and marries her, and thereafter re-locates to move into a palatial house right next door to Shweta. Shortly thereafter a number of incidents occur, leading them to suspect Shweta. Senthilnathan invites his foster brother and Psychiatric Dr. Sarvanan to assist them and possibly treat Shweta - not realizing that the entity behind these incidents is a vengeful spirit that will soon engulf and endanger everyone's lives.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
