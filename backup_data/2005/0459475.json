        "While driving through a mountainous region of India, Occult Investigators, Aryan Srivastav and Divya, come across a woman who is lying unconscious by the roadside. They stop to provide assistance, take her in their vehicle, find out that her name is Natasha, who hears someone calling her name, and jumps out of the running vehicle, knocking herself unconscious against a tree. They take her to the house of a woman named Nalini Sen, and it is where they find out Natasha is not exactly who she claims to be, but may a woman who is concealing her identity to cover-up for the murder of Professor Chandramohan Xeno, whose body has been recovered by the police. Watch how the duo try to unravel this mystery and find out who exactly Natasha is; whose voice only she can hear; and why she killed Professor Xeno.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
