        "Police inspector Uday Singh Rathore (Irrfan) is a depressed insomniac. When a beautiful model Maya Solomon (Ilene Hamann) is murdered at her home, Rathore gets the case. On the list of suspects are Harsh (Suhel Seth) - a famous journalist and Maya's closest friend, Ali (Himanshu Malik) - Maya's playboy fianc\u00e9 and Shyamoli (Shyamoli Verma) - Maya's aunt and Ali's secret lover. Harsh tells Rathore about the hypnotic spell that was inevitably cast by Maya's mere presence on all the people around her and soon Rathore, too, finds himself being infatuated with the beauty and perceived innocence of the dead woman. But when Maya herself turns up alive few nights later, the pressure increases on Rathore to solve the case as quickly as possible and also to come to terms with his feelings for the woman whom he hitherto considered to be unattainable.::Soumitra"
