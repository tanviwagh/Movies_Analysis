        "_Morning Raga_ (qv) is about the meeting of worlds. It is a story that brings the modern and traditional together, unites the past with present, Carnatic music with Western music, as never before in the history of humanity, fate and coincidence with individual choices. It is a story of our times where our worlds are interacting with each other.::Anwar"

    "synopsis": "Swarnalatha (Shabana Azmi), a Carnatic music singer from a South Indian village, blames herself for the death of her son and her violinist-accompanist friend Vaishnavi (Ranjani Ramakrishnan) in a bus accident when they were on the way to the city to participate in a music concert.Fast forward twenty years later. Her dead friend's son Abhinay (Prakash Rao) and his girlfriend Pinky (Perizaad Zorabian) have caught the music bug and are itching to make it big and become famous. Abhinay returns to the village with Pinky following him soon after. Their common passion for music draws Abhinay and Pinky to Swarnalatha.Besides their passion for music, Swarnalatha, Abhinay and Pinky also share something else - the old accident on the bridge.The rustic setting, straightforward story and the fluidity and grace of Morning Raga cast a bewitching spell on the audience. Frankly, there is no one quiet like Shabana Azmi in Bollywood.\nContributed by: Rashid Ashraf (zest70pk@gmail.com)"
