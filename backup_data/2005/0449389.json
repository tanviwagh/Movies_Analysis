        "Raj loves to paint the town red, maroon and crimson too. Bhavana prefers the colors of spirituality. He wants fun 'n' frolic in the bed room, she prefers pooja paath in the prayer room. Veer moves to a flirt beat. Diya's heart beats for acting. He wants to rock 'n' roll in but the only role she will consider is the one in films. Aryan is god's gift to women wanting love. Sonia is a life line for women wanting divorce. He will appeal to woo her in bed. Meanwhile, no one knew that three bomb shells Madhuri, Dimple and Rekha will have an explosion blast with Raj, Veer and Aryan. And most important of all is the Kabab Mein Haddi Lucky Bhaiya aka Lukhwinder Singh. He will add namak mirchi to the perfect kichadi cooked by the guys and make their wives suspicious and their lives suicidal.::xena4441"
