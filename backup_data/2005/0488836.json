    "synopsis": "This movie depicts the story of the Indian epic hero Hanuman (Mukesh Khanna): the demi-god son of Pawan Dev (Anup Shukla), a god of wind, and Anjani (Pinky Rajput), a princess or noblewoman of the half-human, half-monkeylike subspecies known as Vanaras. As a child, Hanuman picks a fight with Rahu (Arijeet Sengupta), god of the solar eclipse, but is educated by Surya the sun-god (Shailendra Pandey), blessed by Indra the rain-god (Manish Wadhwa), and introduced by god Shiv (Kishore Bhatt) to the young princes Ram (Aparna Jarna/Viraj), Lakshman (Kaustav/Sumeet Pathak), Bharat, and Shatrughan. As a young man, he plays tricks on priests, saints, sages, and hermits, until one of them enchants him never to use his superhuman strength except in the service of others. Subsequently, Hanuman befriends Sugreev (Shahnawaz Pradhan), the brother of Vali (Sanjeev Jaiswal), king of the Vanaras. Meanwhile, Ram grows up to marry the neighboring princess Sita (Mona Shetty).When Vali and Sugreev fight over the throne, Hanuman goes with Sugreev into exile. About the same time, Sita is kidnapped by Ravan (Rajesh Jolly), king of the island of Lanka: a lifelong enemy of Ram's father Dasharath (Kumar Pravesh). Ram and Lakshman turn to Sugreev for help in rescuing her, and reunite with Hanuman. With Ram's help, Sugreev kills Vali to claim the throne; he is later persuaded by Hanuman and Lakshman to send his army, under the veteran Jambavant (Raj Joshi) and Vali's son Angad (Amar Babaria), in search of Sita.After a long search, the Vanaras meet Sampati the vulture-king (Vinod Kulkarni), who confirms Ravan has Sita captive, and shows them the way to Lanka. Hanuman goes alone to find her, and assures her that Ram and the army will come to her rescue; then challenges Ravan's guards. When captured by Ravan's son Meghnath (Manoj Pandey), Hanuman demands Sita's safe return, and Ravan instead orders Hanuman to be set afire. By virtue of his divine heritage and numerous blessings, Hanuman is unharmed, and sets fire to Ravan's palace, and escapes.After Hanuman's return, the Vanara army build a bridge across the Palk Strait to invade Lanka. A brief war follows, with heavy losses on both sides; prominently Ravan's gigantic brother Kumbhkaran (Parminder Ghumman). Lakshman is severely wounded by Meghnath, and Hanuman is sent by Sushain (Chanddhar), the Vanaras' medical officer, to the Himalayas for ingredients for the necessary medicine. Unable to identify the proper plant, Hanuman brings the entire mountain, and later puts it back.Ultimately, Ram kills Ravan, and Ravan's brother Vibhishan (Pawan Shukla) becomes king of Lanka, and frees Sita. The dying Ravan repents of his past, and recognizes Ram as an incarnation of the god Vishnu (Saptrishi Ghosh), and Hanuman as a partial incarnation of Shiv. Ram, Hanuman, and the army return home in triumph, and the film concludes."
