The fork punctures the tire of another passing vehicle, this one carrying Sukhwinder, his wife Mitali, and their son. When Sukhwinder attempts to fix the tire, Avinash's car roars by and hits Mitali. Avinash stops his car and bundles Sukhwinder and his family into it despite Kashmira's protests, and stops at a motel for help, but once inside they find only the Manager, Adi, and the rains have disabled the telephone. Now Avinash must drive 20 km to the hospital. He picks up Sonia, whose car has stalled, and together they make their way to the hospital but are halted by the flooding--and then the car breaks down entirely. Another car appears and its occupants, Varun and his wife Mahek, help Avinash and Sonia return to the motel. Also stranded there are Senior Inspector Jatin and a convicted murderer who is being transported to jail. What more could happen on this stormy night?",
