        "Forgetful Sahasra is employed as a singer at a TV Station, and lives by herself. On a Saturday night, she and her friend attend a discotheque, and the following morning Sahasra wakes up to nothing but chaos as she is told that it is not Sunday, but Monday. Sahasra sets about to find out what exactly happened after her Saturday night outing - and will soon find herself being confronted by assorted gangsters and strangers claiming to know her, as well as become suspect in two homicides that occurred on the same day that she is unable to account for.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
