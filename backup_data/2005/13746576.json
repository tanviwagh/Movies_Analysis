    "plot outline": "Mathi (Harish Raghavendra), a happy-go-lucky youngster, returns to his village after studying at a hostel in Chennai. Upon his arrival, he falls under the spell of the college student and Bharatanatyam dancer Malar (Keerthi). Mathi was in love with Malar when he was a kid and even gave her a love letter. Malar's elder brother Sakthivel (Sudhi Nambiar) and Mathi then fought and started to hate each other. When Mathi's father knew about it, he punished his son by sending him to a hostel in the city. Sakthi and Mathi's elder sister Selvi (Arpitha) are secretly in love for many years, and they want to get married with their parents' approval, whereas Malar reciprocates Mathi's love. As the years passed, the hatred intensifies between Sakthi and Mathi. One day, Sakthi witnesses Mathi and his sister romancing, and Sakthi scolded her. Thereafter, Malar gets a chance to play a sister role in a film. She accepts the role with the support of her family. Following the success of the film, a film manager gives her an opportunity to play a heroine role and compels her to come to Chennai. The two lovers have disappeared the same night, and Sakthi tries to track down the couple. Many days later, a distraught Malar returns to her village alone. Malar's body is then found hanging from a tree, and her postmortem report reveals that she was sexually abused. Mathi returns home and then has a fight with Sakthi. Mathi then explains that he did not elope with her. That night, he and his friends decided to attend a birthday party in Chennai, so they went there without people knowing it. Sakthi then apologizes for mistaking him. Later, Mathi gives the film manager a lift. During the talk, the film manager confessed that he had brainwashed Malar to come to Chennai and that he had raped her. An outraged Mathi crashed the car into a rock and killed the film manager. In his hospital bed, Mathi begs Sakthi to take care of his sister Selvi and then dies of his injuries.",
