His hard work pays off when his parents let him adopt a scruffy mutt he names Hubble. Both boy and dog get more than they bargained for when Owen wakes up one morning to discover he can understand every word Hubble says, including the ominous phrase: \"Take me to your leaders.\" Owen learns that dogs came to Earth thousands of years ago to colonize and dominate the planet.

    "synopsis": "Twelve-year-old Owen Baker (Liam Aiken) made a deal with his parents, that if he works hard as a neighborhood dog-walker all summer, they will reward him with a dog of his own. Summer ends and they go to the dog pound to adopt a dog. Owen chooses a dog that has just flown to Earth from Sirius the `Dog Star' and names him Hubble. Hubble (Canid 3942 - voiced by Matthew Broderick) is a secret agent sent to Earth to investigate why Earth dogs haven't communicated with Sirius. Thousands of years earlier, dogs from Sirius were sent on a mission to colonize and rule Earth. The Great Dane leader has heard rumors that Earth dogs have strayed from their mission, and that they are now pets of humans. If she finds this to be true, she will recall all the dogs on Earth back to Sirius. One night Owen follows Hubble to his spaceship, and while the dog is communicating with Sirius, Owen has an accident with the communicator, enabling him to understand what dogs are saying. Together, Owen and Hubble must shape up the dogs that Owen has been walking, before the Great Dane arrives on Earth. The fate of all Earth dogs hangs in the balance. This is a good simple movie for kids. Not a lot of action or special effects, but it has a good story line of a boy and his dog, even though the dog is from outer space. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)"
