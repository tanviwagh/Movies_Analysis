One that led to the glorious road of Friendship! Their bond was unshakable. If Karan gave Raj a home and all the material comforts, Raj gave Karan a shoulder and all the emotional security. If Karan supported Raj at every step, Raj covered up for all of Karan's misdoings. They laughed together, lied together, loved together and fought the odds together all in the name of friendship. Their blind faith in each other attracted the envy of the world. But it was this very world that never let them forget that theirs was not a relationship of equals. And how long could an unequal relationship sustain? Karan and Raj defied conventions proving that true friendship was above all such trivialities. But like a bolt out of the blue came a raging storm that threatened to sink the ship that housed the sentiments of the two friends. Was it ego? A misunderstanding? Or something more? Will it mean the end of their friendship? Will they succumb to it or will their bond survive the grueling test of time? Many talk about friendship. But only a few comprehend its sanctity.",

        "Karan Thapar lives a wealthy yet very lonesome lifestyle with his businessman dad, mom-Kiran, and sister-Nandini, as no one has time for him. One day while at the family's farmhouse, he loses his step and almost falls down a deep gorge, but is rescued by Raj Malhotra, who is an orphan, living a poor lifestyle with his abusive maternal uncle. Karan and Raj become inseparable friends, and Raj moves in to live with Karan, much to the chagrin of the Thapar family who shun and dislike Raj. Years later both Raj and Karan have matured, while Raj is in love with his childhood sweetheart, Anjali and wants to marry her, while Karan flirts with Leena Bharucha, and abandons her. Karan subsequently meets with London-returned Kajal Sharma, successfully woos and then gets her to agree to marry him. Both Raj's and Karan's wedding is planned on the same day, when things take a turn for the worse - when Leena and her dad, who is employed by Thapar, expose both friends as flirts - resulting in all-round acrimony - with Anjali getting married elsewhere; Kajal disappearing from Karan's life; and Raj, who wants to seek his very own identity, decides to leave Raj's life for good, leaving Karan alone with his loneliness and his newfound pal - alcohol.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
