        "Havaldar Nihaal B. Singh lives in Punjab, India with his dad, who is the town Sarpanch, his mom, an unmarried sister, Satnam. He has another married sister, Manjeet, who lives in New York along with her husband, Tayyab Ali. One day Nihaal comes across a man named Romeo driving a jeep. On closer inspection, Nihaal finds that he has a sack of money, no driving license, no permit for his revolver, and no excuses. He ties him to haul him to the police station, but feels sorry for him when he is told that he has been stealing to get medical treatment for his daughter. In this manner Romeo fools Nihaal and escapes, leaving Nihaal to be suspended from work, as Romeo had just killed a Catholic Priest. His suspension has also adverse on his family, as his dad can no longer be the town Sarpanch, and Satnam's marriage is canceled. Humiliated and angry, the entire family is mocked by the entire town and labeled traitors. Then Nihaal gets a chance to redeem himself when he is approached by America's Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to identify and locate Romeo, who is the \"most wanted\" criminal with ties to terrorists. Nihaal readily agrees but must travel to New York to try and identify Romeo. His mother and sister are very worried about him, but he promises to call them regularly. While expecting good news that Nihaal has finally apprehended Romeo, the family are shocked to learn that Nihaal has instead helped Romeo to escape from the FBI, and Nihaal himself is now on the most wanted list of the FBI.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
