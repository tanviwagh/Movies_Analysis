In order to make up for his business losses, Ravi hires some men to kidnap Anamika, hold her for ransom, demand two million American dollars, and then release her. Ravi hires an elderly, alcoholic bodyguard named Suryaveer Singh, who dislikes crowds and children. He does warm up to the bubbly Anamika and both share a bond - which is broken when Anamika is kidnapped from her piano school, Surya is severely wounded, but does manage to shoot three abductors. He recovers in hospital, and is quite upset that he has failed in his job. Meanwhile Ravi is quite relieved that the kidnapping has gone according to plan, he does notify the police, and they set up a trap to apprehend the kidnappers. But then something goes terribly wrong, the police end up shooting and killing the men, who in turn kill Anamika. Surya, who is on his way home to India, cancels his trip, returns and starts asking questions, not knowing that he is going to unearth a web of deceit, lies and deception, which may only end when he uncovers the entire truth or die's trying.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
