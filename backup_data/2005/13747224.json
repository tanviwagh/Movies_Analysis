In the meantime, the carefree young man \"Burma\" Bala (S. Suresh), an ardent fan of Narmadha, wants to marry her. Thereafter, \"Burma\" Bala and Narmadha's maid Kausi (Madhupriya) fall in love with each other. After a new misunderstanding, Narmadha orders Bala to get out of her house. Her father Ramkumar (Rajesh) then explains to her why Bala worked for them all along despite her insulting remarks. A few years back, Bala was the son of the village chief and dreamt to become a playback singer.

Later, Narmadha's first film got negative reviews during the test screening, so the film's financier planned to kill Narmadha before its release to create publicity thus making it a blockbuster film. Bala who had listened to his conversation tried to save her from the goons. During the fight, Narmadha and Bala got injured in the head but they managed to escape and ended up in a mass marriage ceremony. Ramkumar who was with them agreed for the wedding and they got married. When Bala's father (Rajeev) came to know about the wedding, he gave Bala one of his properties and disowned his son. Later at the hospital, Narmadha had been diagnosed with selective amnesia (she didn't remember anything for the past 2 years) whereas Bala developed a stutter. To release Narmadha's first film, Bala sold his property and paid the film's producer.

To save his daughter's acting career and her mother's dream, Ramkumar begged Bala to not disclose about their wedding at any moment and Bala began to work as her car driver. Narmadha, who finally comes to know about Bala's sacrifices, decides to put an end to her acting career and to live with her husband Bala. Bala and Narmadha live happily ever after.",
