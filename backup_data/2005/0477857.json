        "Ajay Kumar (Warsi) is the newly appointed, honest SSP of Lucknow police. Of his family only his mother (Mulay) remains, and she inspires and motivates him to do the right thing. Ajay tries to crack down on the UP mafia, but more often than not is betrayed by information-leaking local police officials. His boss tries to aid him by shielding him from political pressures, and by getting sanction for Ajay's brainchild - a Special Task Force (STF), which would work across local jurisdictions, and state lines. Criminal activities in UP are dominated by Gajraj (Sushant Singh) and his gang. Aided and abetted in his nefarious activities by feudal lords and politicians, Gajraj is an intelligent and ruthless criminal. Trying to pin him down, the STF takes help from a physics professor Tiwari (Kapoor) who helps them track down cell-phone conversations, and thereby the location of the criminals. The STF then makes headway in combating crime across the state, but is still unable to get Gajraj. The final attempt to get Gajraj forms the climax of the film.::Amodini"
