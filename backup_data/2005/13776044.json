Their families then start to like each other and become good friends. They decide to arrange the marriage between the young couple but they both refuse and Vivek tells them the reason. Krishna and Gayathri fell in love with each other in college. From time to time, they were involved in small quarrels but the couple made it up every time. One day, it was the \"straw that broke the camel's back\": Yuva told his friends about being close to Gayathri and described her, she got angry and they split apart. After finishing college, Gayathri's family moved into a house opposite to that of Yuva. Their families and Vivek try their best to rejoin them but her relative Sri (Sriman) tries to win her heart and Gayathri even accepts to marry Sri. For the marriage of their friend in their college, Krishna and Gayathri return there. Vivek and their collegemates try to convince Krishna and Gayathri to be together again. Krishna has a change of heart, he convinces her with a song and they eventually reconcile.",
