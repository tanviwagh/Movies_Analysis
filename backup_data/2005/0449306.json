Unaware of his \"cargo\", Aditya drives the car to meet his father, until he is stopped at a check-post. That's when he finds out that Lucky is on board. Then terrorists strike out with bombs and guns, and chaos breaks lose, the telephone lines are down, and there is no electricity. Aditya and Lucky manage to escape and hide in an isolated graveyard. Meanwhile, Sekhri and Negi recruit a private investigator, retired Colonel Pindi Das Kapoor, to locate their children, which he agrees to do so. Before he can locate them, Aditya finds out that Lucky has consumed contaminated water, is poisoned, and with communications down - looks like Lucky's luck has finally run out.",
