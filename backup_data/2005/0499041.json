Then one day, the police knock on his door, informing him that his father had lost his hold from a crowded local train, fallen, and instantly killed. A devastated Kunal arranges his father's funeral, and before he could reconcile to living alone, his relatives contact him from Jammu, informing him that his father had promised to look after a young woman named Renuka (Smiley Suri). Kunal agrees to fulfill his father's promise.When Renuka arrives, she finds out about the untimely death, and wants to return, but ticket reservation forces her to stay with Kunal for a week. It is this week that changes their lives, for they fall in love and get married. During their first intimate night together, porn-website creator Simi Roy (Amrita Singh) and her partner Johnny (Ashutosh Rana) record them and turn them into porn-stars.
