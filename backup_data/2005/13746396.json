    "plot outline": "Ganesh (Ganesh) is a carefree youngster living with his three friends (Mayilsamy, Chaplin Balu and Ganeshkar) in a lodge in Chennai. Ganesh has also a friend named Vignesh (Santhosh) who works in a mechanic shed. One night, the car of the television newscaster Priya (Sitara Vaidya) breaks down near Vignesh's mechanic shed. Vignesh repairs her car and he falls in love with Priya. One day, Ganesh saves Priya from rowdies and he is in love with her too. Priya then meets them on multiple occasions and she befriends the two friends. In the meantime, people are mysteriously killed in the city. Thereafter, Priya interviews the corrupt politician Aalavandhan (Mahanadi Shankar) and unmasks many events done by him. After the interview, a vengeful Aalavandhan tries to rape her in his house but she managed to escape. The night, Aalavandhan is killed by Ganesh who is, in reality, the mysterious killer. Ganesh even kills Priya's best friend Rekha who witnessed the murder of Aalavandhan. Many years ago, the ten-years-old Ganesh lived with his widow mother Uma (Indhu) in a guesthouse. One day, the police suspected Uma to have stolen the jewels of her boss and the police arrested her. At the police station, Uma was stripped of her clothing and her dignity. After this incident, she committed suicide by hanging. A vengeful Ganesh killed the police inspector who humiliated his mother and he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment for the murder. When he emerged from the juvenile detention home, Vignesh was a young man who had nowhere to go. He then saw Priya and he fell under her spell. So Ganesh tracked her down, he came to Chennai and he posed as a jobless graduate without any issues. The psychopathy Ganesh then killed anyone who stood in his way or tried to harm his lover Priya. Vignesh and Priya eventually fall in love with each other and they decide to get married. Ganesh then threatens Vignesh to kill him if he marries her. When Priya comes to know that Ganesh is in love with her, she decides to meet him and to settle the problem once and for all. Priya finds the guesthouse where he lived when he was a child and reads his personal diary. Ganesh has written that he loves Priya more than anything and he is going to kill Vignesh. Ganesh and Vignesh who just arrive in the guest house have a fight and Priya runs away from the place. At the harbour, Ganesh tries to kill Vignesh but Priya shoots Ganesh dead with a gun.",
