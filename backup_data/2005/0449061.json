        "New York City. Syd has not seen or heard of his ex-girlfriend _London_ (qv) in two months when he learns that her friend Rebecca is throwing her a farewell party at her parents' upscale spacious condo as _London_ (qv) is moving to Los Angeles tomorrow to be with her new boyfriend. Syd, still obsessed with _London_ (qv), decides to crash the party, and brings along Bateman, who he has just met, the two who have a common drug dealer and Bateman who is looking for a clean place to do their large stash of blow. Syd's appearance does not sit well with Rebecca who wants to protect her friend from who she considers her crazy ex. Before _London_ (qv)'s arrival, Syd and Bateman spend much of the party in the large upstairs bathroom - it the size of most apartments - to do their blow along with whoever else may show up in the bathroom. Syd is trying to get up the nerve to go out and face _London_ (qv), which becomes more and more difficult as time goes on if only because of not wanting to face her without a clear head. In the process, Syd, Bateman and their parade of guests in the bathroom talk about sex, love, philosophy, karma, and other broad life topics while certain talking points make Syd reflect on his two years with _London_ (qv). Even if he does get up the nerve to face _London_ (qv) to tell her how he really feels, will it lead to _London_ (qv) changing her mind about moving and will it bring _London_ (qv) back into his life?::Huggo"

    "synopsis": "Syd (Chris Evans) is a stressed out coke-head who goes to a going away party for his ex-girlfriend, London (Jessica Biel) without being invited. Before the party, he meets up with Bateman (Jason Statham), a banker who brings cocaine to the party. Bateman is an impotent man who has had his share of life troubles. The movie consists of Syd, who locks himself in the bathroom, and remembers his life while dating London for over two years. At the end of the party, Syd finally confronts London and they leave together, to have sex for one last time. They wake up barely in time to make the airport the next morning. Just when one believes they will get back together, London walks to her gate. Syd is seen driving away, though London does promise she will see him again."
