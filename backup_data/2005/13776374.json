    "plot outline": "In Chennai, Shiva (Sathya), a jobless BE graduate, lives with his father Deena Dayalan (Nizhalgal Ravi) who is an assistant commissioner of police and his mother (Ambika). While Kavitha (Sujitha) is a college student living in a ladies hostel. One day, the scooter of Kavitha halts in the street and Shiva repairs it, but Kavitha leaves the place without thanking him. An infuriated Shiva follows Kavitha in his scooter and scolds her for not being thankful. In reply to this, Kavitha tells him that \"thanks\" is just a word and nobody should expect something after helping a person. Another day, at the house of Priya (Abhinayashree), a groom's family comes to see her. As Priya's parents were about to agree for the engagement, Shiva who is also the best friend of Priya's brother Vijay stops it. Kavitha who is Priya's friend reacts with anger for spoiling Priya's life. Later, Shiva meets Kavitha in a shop and clarifies everything: Priya, Vijay and their parents are all orphans and Shiva wanted them to live together as long as possible. Thereafter, Shiva and Kavitha fall in love with each other. One night, Kavitha goes to see her mother (Seetha), a prostitute, in her house in the colony. A police squad headed by Deena Dayalan raid the colony and they arrest many women for alleged prostitution including the innocent Kavitha. Kavitha is then released but Shiva has been deeply shaken by the news and Deena Dayalan tells his son to forget her. A depressed Shiva cannot forget her. After the sudden death of her mother, Kavitha meets Shiva. She tells him everything and Shiva finally understands that she is innocent. On his side, Shiva convinces his parents to support their love and they accept for the marriage. Meanwhile, a saddened Kavitha arrives at the bus station to leave the city. Shiva then finds her at the bus station and he happily announces that they are going to marry with the blessings of his parents. Kavitha falls unconscious (she drank poison before) and she says to him \"I love you\" before dying on his lap. The film ends with a distraught Shiva dying of heart attack on the spot.",
