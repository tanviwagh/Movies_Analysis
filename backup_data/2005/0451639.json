She decides to let her orphaned niece, Padmini, live with her, and together they device a scheme to entrap wealthy men, relieve them of their money, abandon them, and move on to better targets. They do succeed for quite a while, assuming various disguises, and names, amassing a vast fortune, until Padmini falls in love with one of her targets, a young man named Raghu, and decides to call it quits. An unstable Rukmini, who owes money to Monty, decides she cannot go it alone and concocts a scheme that will force Padmini to give up on Raghu and re-join forces with her to go on philandering unsuspecting wealthy men. Rukmini's first move is to seduce an equally unsuspecting Raghu and ensure that Padmini is a witness to this. The question remains, will a street-smart Padmini allow herself to be taken in by her aunt?",
