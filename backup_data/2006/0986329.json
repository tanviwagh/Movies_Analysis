    "synopsis": "Mungaru Male (Kannada: ) (literal translation - Monsoon Rain, Southwest Monsoon in terms of Meteorology) is a Kannada language movie directed by Yograj Bhat featuring Ganesh, Sanjana Gandhi, and Anant Nag in leading roles. The movie is arguably one of the biggest hits in South Indian cinema with box office earnings crossing Rs 65 Crores at the end of 400 days after its release. The movie set a national record as the first Indian language movie to run for 1 year at PVR Cinemas nationwide. The movie made Ganesh a household name in Karnataka and he is now one of the leading stars in our industry.Preetham (Ganesh) is a modern guy who has no future plans for himself and is cunningly taken to Malnad by his mother for her friend's daughter's wedding. There he meets Nandini (Pooja/Sanjana Gandhi), the girl of his dreams (of course, love at first sight) who he had seen in a mall in Bangalore. To his immense surprise, he finds out that she is the bride who is getting married within the week and leaves because of heartache. But, Nandini jokingly challenges him to come back and win her heart. Preetham accepts the challenge and returns. There he befriends her father, Col. Subbaiah (Ananth Nag) and her mother. Will Preetham win over her or will she marry the other guy? The tagline for the movie is \"Love is Sweet, Sacrifice is Immortal\"."
