Goes back to meet his brother (played by Murali) who still lives at their ancestral home. A terminal illness being suffered by Murali brings them closer. The movie also goes a little into natural healing, and how inner psychology plays a bigger role in the status of a person's illness. I wouldn't call it a must-watch. But a nice one for slow / art movie lovers.",
