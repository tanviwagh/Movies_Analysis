Kiran does not make it as 'Miss India', but Prashant is lucky enough to survive an attempt on his life. Both of them assemble a team of TV reporters and journalists to target corrupt politicians, and get considerable publicity when they successfully expose Maharashtra State's Home Minister Shribhavna Prasad. Then the entire team, including Kiran herself, gets a shock after Prashant announces publicly that he will be joining a political party and will be contesting forthcoming elections. When confronted, he admits that he only wishes to join in order to expose corruption from within. The question remains will political big-wigs permit him to be one of them in their corrupt regime?",
