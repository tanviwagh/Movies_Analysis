        "Arjun's love Shivani, is arranged to be married to another man, his cousin Kishan comes to his rescue. But when a master of disguise and expert con artist, Kishan is hunted by one of the victims he had scammed, he ends up masquerading as Arjun's aunt, Sunaina. The plot further thickens when Kishan unknowingly acquires a property of a don and becomes his target.",
        "6 Alvarez House in Bandra, Bombay, is the residence of myopic, widowed, devout Hindu, Satyabol Shashtri, who lives there with his daughter, Shivani. Shivani is in love with her Christian neighbor, Arjun Fernandes, who works as a Mechanic and lives with his wanna-be singer sister, Julie, and a younger ailing sister, Titli. Satyabol disapproves of Arjun and wants his daughter to get married to Sarju Maharaj Banaraswale's son. Other than Satyabol chasing Badshah, the pet dog of Arjun, and ending up in the woman's bathroom, the area is fairly peaceful. But after Sarju hands over a pair of high-heeled shoes to Shivani - a motley group of characters are going to descend on this neighborhood. Chief amongst them being Kishan, the ultimate master of disguise; Nepali Rana Jang Bahadur, who is out to settle old scores with Kishan; Matha Prasad, who runs a dairy farm and moonlights as the hit-man of Bangkok-based underworld don, Carlos; Arjun's mysterious 'aunt' named Sunaina - who will soon be pursued by a love-lorn Satyabol; the once honest Police Inspector Mane, who along with Carlos' girlfriend, Sania, is on the lookout for hidden diamonds; and last but not the least, facing near bankruptcy, - Carlos himself - as they face/off in one of the most hilarious stand-offs to seek wealth to and fulfill their individual dreams.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
