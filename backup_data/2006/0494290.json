However the loving Chacha arranges a match for Poonam with the son of a wealthy, industrialist family from Delhi. Where Prem (Shahid Kapoor) is the magnanimous bride-groom, who decides that he will spend a month of each year at his wife's parents' home, well-brought up Pooja is the perfect shudh Hindi speaking addition to the clan.

However, Rama is jealous of her and barely talks to her, since Poonam is more beautiful than her own daughter Rajni (Amrita Prakash), who is lively and friendly. Bhagat-ji (Manoj Joshi), a jeweller, and a friend of Krishna Kant, likes Poonam very much and decides to matchmake her with Prem (Shahid Kapoor), Mr. Harish Chandra's (Anupam Kher) son, as Bhagat-ji is friends with Mr. Harishchandra.\nMr. Harishchandra informs Prem of his plans to matchmake him, as he believes Prem is of proper age, young enough to adapt to someone else, and, Prem's brother, Sunil (Samir Soni), was about the same age when he married Bhavna (Lata Sabharwal). Prem, however, is hesitant to marry, since he thinks himself to be too young and wants to focus on his career first. Harishchandra convinces him to meet Poonam first. They visit Poonam's family and let Prem and Poonam to get to know each other. Though their first conversation is awkward, Prem and Poonam decide to get married, as they are instantly attracted to each other.

Krishna Kant invites Prem's family to their summer residence in Som Sarovar and Harishchandra accepts.Poonam anxiously awaits Prem to come to Som Sarovar, however, until Bhavna arranges a meeting between the two, they barely have the chance to talk to each other. After several carefree days, Harishchandra and his family has to leave again because of the family business, which leaves Poonam and Prem only the opportunity to communicate via telephone, internet or letter. Despite the distance between them, they grow closer and Prem, before going to a business trip to Japan, tells Poonam on the phone that he has fallen in love with her. When Prem comes back from Japan, Poonam is there to greet him on the airport, gets to spend some time at his house and finally returns to her own family on order to prepare for the wedding.However, two days before the actual wedding, a fire emerges at Krishna Kant's house. Even though Poonam runs out of the house in time, she realizes that Rajni is still inside and goes to save her. In this attempt Poonam gets heavily burnt. Prem, occupied with his own wedding preparations, is informed by Bhavna of Poonam's accident and goes to see his fiancee at the hospital. She is very unsure if Prem will marry her, now that she has been scarred. The doctor (Mohnish Behl) informs the family that there is hope, however the operation to save Poonam may be dangerous and Poonam will take much time to recover. Harishchandra arranges for specialists to be flown in from Delhi and Prem, despite her injury, still wishes to marry her and accepts her as a wife by bringing sindhoor to her at the hospital. The operation is successful and the wedding commences. They get married joyfully and enjoy their lives together as husband and wife."
