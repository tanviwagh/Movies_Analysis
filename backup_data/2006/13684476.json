    "plot outline": "Azhagesan (Shivhasan) is a jobless youngster and a chain smoker who spends his time roaming with his friends in the village. His mother Ponnatha (Vadivukkarasi) loves him more than anything and spoils him while his father Paramasivam (Rajesh) hates him for being a wastrel. Azhagesan and Deivana (Shravya), the daughter of the village bigwig Ramasamy (Sethu Vinayagam), fall in love with each other. Their love affair crosses through mild hassles like when Deivanai's cousin Vinod (Vinod), an army man on a trip to his village, seeks her hand in marriage. Vinod realises that she is in love with Vinod, so Anand genuinely accepts their love and he leaves the village. Meanwhile, Azhagesan's cousin Valli (Preethi Varma) arrives at his village and starts to woo Azhagesan. The villagers decide to not consume alcohol until the end of the village festival. The last day of the festival, the angry arrack traders create a ruckus in the village. The huts of the villagers catch fire and many villagers have died including Deivanai. The incident disturbs the peace of the place causing friction between two communities. The fire was, in fact, caused by Azhagesan who had inadvertently tossed out his cigarette butt in a haystack that day. When the villagers come to know about it, they beat him up and a remorseful Azhagesan begs them to kill him for his carelessness but they let him go. The film ends with a saddened Azhagesan leaving the village.",
