After driving for approximately 300 kilometres, Yohaa finds his employer's daughter Renuka (Poornitha) in the back seat of the car who was sleeping all along. Renuka first gets angry and scolds Yohaa for kidnapping her. Yohaa tells her that he didn't do it on purpose and he should not have a police record if he wants to become a serviceman. Renuka sympathises with his plight and they travel to Vijayawada to meet Yohaa's friend Varadhan (Rajesh), a sub-inspector of police, who will help him out of his problems. In the past, Yohaa lived happily in Vijayawada with his parents and he dreamt to become a serviceman. His father then died of a heart attack.
