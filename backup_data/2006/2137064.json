She then recounts her very own story of being forcibly confined by Bijnor-based Jaswant Sisodiya, an influential gangster, who loves her insanely but refuses to marry her. Her as well as doctor father's attempts to seek justice are all in vain. Then Jaswant's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, known only as Rajvir's son, re-enters Jaswant's life. He is very loyal and dedicated to the latter, and does everything he is told without question. When attacked by a group who oppose Jaswant, he kills seven men, is arrested, tried in Court, and acquitted. He then saves Jaswant's life from an assassin allegedly hired by S.P. Bhupen Singh, and then ensures the latter's demise. Then Jaswant's life faces more challenges when the Criminal Investigation Department from Lucknow launches an inquiry following a complaint from Anju and her dad. It is this move that will compel Jaswant to force Dr. Khanna to withdraw this complaint by making it clear that if he cannot have Anju for himself then he will ensure that she becomes 'public property' - and he will arrange her to be sold to a brothel - and then transported to Dubai.",
