        "As a forty-something door-to-door book salesman, _Jerry_ (qv) is used to having doors shut in his face. However, a chance meeting with Jordan, an engaging young punk rocker, opens the door into a new world.",
        "_Jerry_ (qv) Arthur, a middle-aged door to door book salesman, is barely surviving his lonely wasted life when he encounters a group of punk twenty-somethings lead by a stunning girl named Jordan. _Jerry_ (qv) begins to hang out with the kids and slowly becomes one of them, just as his estranged daughter, Trisha, moves back home.::Morgan Mead",
        "_Jerry_ (qv) Arthur is a 40-something guy who is stuck in a dead-end door-to-door sales job for a local publishing company, where the only sales pitch he's usually able to get out before having the door slammed in his face is, \"My name is _Jerry_ (qv).\" He also has a strained relationship with his teenage daughter, Trisha, who he has not seen for several years. _Jerry_ (qv)'s life changes when he stumbles into the wrong house on his way to a party and meets 20-something punk rocker Jordan and her crew. This young woman creates a spark in _Jerry_ (qv)'s once boring daily routine when she befriends him and takes him on a journey through her punk-rock lifestyle, that brings life back into his job and his relationships.::Rachel Boison"
