    "plot outline": "After the Indian Government ordered troops into the Soni Darbar in Amritsar, angering Sikhs worldwide, leading to the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi during 1984, followed by violence against the Sikhs, and instructions to Police to hunt down and apprehend all suspected terrorists. Karnail Singh was one such suspect, who claims that he has had no hand in any terrorism activity, but is nevertheless pursued by the Police, leaving his widowed mom, Kartar, and sister, Parsan, to fend for themselves by running a Dhaba and being subjected to harassment at the hands of Inspector Ujagar Singh, while the village Mukhiya wants Parsan to get married to a much older Narang Singh. Parsan's problems are resolved when Indian Army Captain Nihal Singh intervenes, and marries her, even though her mom, beaten senseless by the Police, passes away on the day of the marriage. Months later, Nihal must re-locate to Siachen, leaving behind a pregnant Parsan. Once in Siachen, he gets news that Parsan has been attacked and is hospitalized. Since Siachen is isolated due to a heavy snowstorm, he can only return home after several days, and is told that Parsan has passed away, and his new-born daughter has been abducted by his neighbors, Sukhwant Kaur, and Mandeep Singh. Nihal's attempts to locate the couple are all in vain, and things get worse when the Station House Officer is transferred and the new incumbent, his arch-enemy, Ujagar, refuses to locate his daughter. Nihal confronts Ujagar, arguments and fisticuffs ensue, resulting in Ujagar's death. Nihal is arrested, stripped off of his uniform, tried in Court, found guilty, and sentenced to 20 years in jail - and may never be reunited with his daughter.",
