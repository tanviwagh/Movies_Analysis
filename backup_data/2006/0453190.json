Ram, who gets arrested for murdering his mother, is interrogated by police inspector Umar (Rehman). Meanwhile, sub-inspector Malaichamy (Murali) and also a neighbor of Ram's family gets annoyed when his son and his daughter Karthika (Gazala) are summoned for interrogation by Umar. But every one's effort leads to tracking down of the real killer. The rest is all but how Ram goes kill his mother's killers.::Hariharan"
