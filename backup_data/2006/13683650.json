    "plot outline": "Mukhil (Amaran), an army officer, returns to his village for his holidays. Upon his return, he meets the bubbly girl Indhu (Payal) who seems to be mentally ill. Mukhil lives with his widow mother Chellamma (Kuyili) and his immature uncle Yedhukku (Ilavarasu). One day, Mukhil saves Indhu who was sexually harassed by some rowdies and he beats them up. Mukhil starts having suspicions about the way Indhu was behaving, so one day, he forcibly kisses her on the mouth to see her reaction. Indhu scolds him for behaving like that and spits on his face. Indhu belongs to a poor family, she lives with her sick grandmother and her little brother Suresh. Mukhil then apologizes for his disgusting act to Indhu and he professes his love to her but she doesn't respond. Mukhil was so desperate to figure out why Indhu is acting like a mentally ill person, so he asks her to tell him the whole story the next day otherwise he will consider suicide. The next day, Indhu's grandmother dies, therefore, she could not meet Mukhil, so Mukhil attempts to commit suicide but the villagers save him. Later, Indhu accepts his love and reveals to the villagers that she is not mentally ill. A few years ago, Indhu witnessed a government official being killed by the village bigwig Malayandi (Kovai Desingu). In the past, she was born to a devadasi (prostitute) and her mother died during childbirth. As per the village custom, Indhu must be brought up by a Brahmin family and at the age of majority, she had to become a devadasi. Seenu (Srinivasa Gurukkal) adopted her but when she hit puberty, he refused his daughter to be a devadasi. Seenu knew that he could not change his daughter's faith so he chose to commit suicide. Since that day, Indhu has to act like a mentally ill person to not become a devadasi. The village court decides to send Indhu to Malayandi's village. Malayandi plans to get married with Indhu thus she will become a devadasi. Chellamma then orders her son to save his lover from this evil practice. Mukhil enters their village and fights with Malayandi's henchmen, during the fight, Mukhil was deeply wounded by the henchmen. He manages to knock Malayandi out and stops the wedding, he then advises the villagers to abolish this ancestral practice. Malayandi asks for forgiveness and he decides to become a good man.
