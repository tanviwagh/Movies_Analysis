    "plot outline": "The film starts with Justin (Richard Rishi) getting released from jail while his friend Natty (Natarajan Subramaniam) is waiting for him. A writer who witnesses this decided to write a biography on them. Justin and Natty are friends since childhood. They first met during the death of their respective parents. Both work as henchmen to Nair (Nassar). They are his loyal servants and are prepared to lay their lives for him. However, a sequence of events results in Nair developing mistrust and hatred on the two. He employs another youth, Adi (Aditya Srivastav), in their place and plans to bump them off. Eventually, Justin ends up in prison, and Nattu loses his leg thanks to Nair's plans. After three years (when Justin completes his jail term), Justin, along with Natty, decides to stay away from violence and lead a peaceful life. Charu (Madhumitha), a girl-next-door, falls in love with Justin, and both decide to marry. Meanwhile, a reformed Nair seeks an apology to both Natty and Justin before his death. However, when things go smooth in their lives, a previous enmity leaves Nair's henchmen making an attempt on Justin's life, which eventually claims Charu's life. In the climax, Justin stabs Aditya, while Justin himself gets stabbed and dies. The film ends with Natty carrying Justin and both jumping into the sea and dying.",
