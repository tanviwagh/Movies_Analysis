    "plot outline": "The film begins with the little girl Abhi and her grandfather Shanmugasundaram (Shanmugasundaram) walking along the beach. Abhi moves away from her grandfather and drowned at the beach. The kind-hearted young man Ganapathy (Udhai) who witnesses it saves Abhi from drowning. Thereafter, Abhi meets Ganapathy who is cleaning the temple and her grandmother Kamalam thanks him for saving her granddaughter's life that day and takes Ganapathy home. At her home, Ganapathy says that he is an orphan who does odd jobs for a living and Shanmugasundaram offers him a job in his big house filled with children. The new servant Ganapathy easily wins the hearts of the children in a short period of time. Everything goes well until Ganapathy meets Raghupathi (Rajesh) who tries to enter in Shanmugasundaram's house. A few years ago, in Mumbai, the poor Ganapathy struggles to find a job and the terrorist Raghupathi gives him an assignment. Ganapathy did it triumphantly but when he came to know about Raghupathi's identity, he was shocked and immediately left Mumbai. Raghupathi turns out to be Shanmugasundaram's long-lost son and he wants to stay in his father's house to hide from the police. But Ganapathy beats Raghupathi up and drives him away during the absence of Shanmugasundaram. Later, Shanmugasundaram's family friend Jyothi (Mathisha), a college student, falls in love with Ganapathy and proposes her love to him but the faithful Ganapathy who has a lot of respect for Shanmugasundaram refuses to fall in love with her. Raghupathi comes back again to the house and Shanmugasundaram welcomes him with open arms. Raghupathi tells Shanmugasundaram that Ganapathy throws him out when Shanmugasundaram wasn't home and Shanmugasundaram orders him to throw Ganapathy out of the house, and he does so. The children who like him so much cannot forget him. Afterwards, Raghupathi has a fight with the other terrorists and Ganapathy comes to his rescue. During the fight, Ganapathy is stabbed and Raghupathi fled from the place. Later that night, Jyothi who sees the unconscious Ganapathy on the middle of the street takes him to the hospital. Raghupathi then tells everything to his father and a guilty Shanmugasundaram goes to the hospital with his family. A few days later, a healed Ganapathy returns to their house and promises that he will never leave them.",
