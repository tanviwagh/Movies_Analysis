When the Court rules otherwise, Maniram stops all support for Sanjeev, who then borrows money from his close friend, Sunil, to complete his education. Then Maniram arranges Sanjeev's marriage with a young woman named Gauri, the only daughter of millionaire Ram Prasad. Sanjeev agrees to this marriage, gets married, and thereafter leaves as he finds out that Gauri is blind. Maniram gets Sunil to convince Sanjeev to return to his wife, so Sunil and Sanjeev go on a hunting trip, where Sanjeev is attacked by an enraged elephant, thrown off a cliff, and believed to be dead. But he survives, and several months later, returns to Maniram's house, where, to his horror, he finds that Sunil has taken over his identity and is now living with Gauri. Watch closely as an enraged Sanjeev decides to find out what really happened after his accident, and the circumstances that made Sunil live with Sanjeev's wife.",
