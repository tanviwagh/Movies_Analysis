While her friends settle for rustic nobodies, Kundavi doesn't find her Mr Right in that village. So she is pushed into a normal marriage that she doesn't want. On the other hand, there is Gautham (Suriya) who is also strangely not keen in the marriage. But the invisible string of fate through the knot of marriage ties them together.",
