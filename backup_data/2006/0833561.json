To the world she is a successful and independent woman, but she's actually lonely and lost, a mere puppet in Nikhil's hands. Aditya Garewal (Shiney Ahuja) is an aspiring director keen on casting Sana for his debut film, but only on his own terms; he is willing to go to any lengths to get her to agree to the film, even if that means preying on her slight insecurities and her turbulent relationship with Nikhil. Nikhil is successful in casting her in her film, which turns out to be a super hit. But somewhere along the way he realizes that he just can't pull away from Sana; he has actually fallen in love with her in spite of his friend Sam (Purab Kohli) reminding him that Sana is just their ladder to success. As the film progresses Aditya realizes that Sana is not just insecure and lonely; she's also mentally unbalanced, suffering from acute schizophrenia. She's haunted by the imaginary Rani who leads her to believe that everyone is out to kill her. Sana's mother and Nikhil get her admitted to the hospital and resort to shock treatment to speed up her recovery so she can return to all her assignments. What follows is Aditya's unshakable belief that he can heal Sana; he even gives up his burgeoning career to take her away from the industry and free Sana from all of her mental demons. But she's unable to break free of her illness, and one day she walks out of Aditya's life, no longer wanting to be the cause of pain and turbulence in his life. Three years later they meet in a hospital after Sana's suicide attempt.",

        "Sana Azim once lived in Junagadh with her widowed mom. She was discovered by Nikhil Rai, who introduced her to Bollywood's tinsel screen, and from then on this actress never looked back. She lived with Nikhil in a strange relationship; he ordered her around, controlled her--even physically abused her. When journalist/filmmaker Aditya Garewal wrote about Sana, he described her in very unflattering terms, angering her, which led to a well-publicized confrontation which was merely a ploy Aditya used, successfully, to compel Sana to act in his films. They started working together and were drawn to each other, and Aditya was drawn into Sana's dark, unstable world, where she was controlled by a woman named Rani who has made her believe that Aditya will kill her--and the only thing she can do is kill Aditya first.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
