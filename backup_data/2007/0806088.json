The trio suspect each other of being the father, then attempt to get rid of the child, but change their mind, look after her, name her Angel, adore her, and start a frantic and hilarious search for her mother. A few months later Isha shows up, takes Angel in her possession and returns home. The trio now mend their ways, and Arush attempts in vain to win back Isha, and ends up challenging her to marry someone else in 7 days. With Isha's attractive looks and wealthy background it will not be long before she finds someone to wed her, and by the look of things Arush may end up never seeing Angel ever again.",
