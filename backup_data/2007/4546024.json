        "An angry young man tries to give up his violent ways after his marriage runs into trouble. But his nemesis will not rest until he is killed.",
        "Kombaya Pandian (Karthi) is a butcher by profession and he leads his life by virtues. If anyone ill-treats women or cheats in business, _Komban_ (qv) would certainly whack them for which he is celebrated by the Aapanadu village people. At one point of time, _Komban_ (qv) falls in love with Palani (Lakshmi Menon) and her father Muthiah (Rajkiran) too agrees for the marriage. But somehow _Komban_ (qv) does not like Muthiah. Meanwhile, few guys badly want to murder both _Komban_ (qv) and Muthiah. Whether _Komban_ (qv) can save his wife and father in law from the deadly guys ?::Surya Kumar",
        "Arasanadu is a village that maintains a steady state due to its valued principles and strive to maintain peace between two warring neighbouring villages. _Komban_ (qv) is the crowd favourite of Arasanadu for his pure heart and courage to rebuke any act of injustice. He falls in love with Pazhani and his family marry him off to her in a bid to reign in his masculine instincts that constantly land him in the bad books of the warring villages' headmen. Pazhani's father Muthaiah, goes the extra mile to ensure a peaceful life for his daughter and rubs the ego of _Komban_ (qv) in the process. The conflicts between the duo and how it all changes with the interference of _Komban_ (qv)'s rivals are what form the rest of this movie.::PipingHotViews"
