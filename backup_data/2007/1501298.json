The stigma and double standards faced by those educated in Tamil-medium schools is explicitly highlighted through the tragic events in the life of Prabhakar (Jiiva), an orphan who is brought up by a Tamil teacher and subsequently becomes passionate about the Tamil language and goes on to become masters graduate in Tamil. This heart-wrenching tale plots Prabhakar's struggles throughout life, his tragic love affair with Anandhi (Anjali) and the terrible sequence of events that gradually causes him to deteriorate into a psychopathic serial killer, who later confesses to killing 22 people in cold blood. What horrific events could have turned a gentle and passionate young boy into a mass murderer?",
