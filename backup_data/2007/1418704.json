        "_Maherchi Maaya_ (qv) is based upon the age old legal issue of a daughter's right to inheritance. Once married, the woman has an equal right to her husband's inheritance; so is such a law essential at all? The lawmakers had the best interest of womankind while forming this law. However greed for wealth makes many stoops to the lowest levels of inhuman behaviour. Maherchi Maya depicts the abyss of human greed and its conspiring nature to acquire wealth and riches. It tells the story of a bond between father and daughter, of people who want the riches overnight, of a young woman who fights rampant superstitions with a modern logical perspective.",
