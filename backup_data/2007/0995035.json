Broke, accident-prone, and unable to pay rent to their landlady, they are basically slackers with Sameer and Gautam having no family, while Pankaj has been kicked out by his brother-in-law, and Martand has illicitly borrowed money from his maternal uncle, is unable to re-pay it and hence rendered homeless. The four find out that they can better their lifestyle by obtaining a bank loan - albeit in vain as they are unable to secure one. Then they decide to woo a rich girl, let one of them marry her, and live their life in comfort. They find out that there is a new girl, Ritu Tripathi, in the neighborhood, who is on the lookout for her missing brother, Rahul. The foursome con her into believing that they are Rahul's friends and befriend her. Pankaj even re-names himself Jai, her fianc\u00e9e, not for long though as she soon finds out that the truth after she meets with Sophie, the woman her brother was supposed to marry, and decides to complain to the Police. Before the Police could arrest the hapless foursome, they are abducted by a gangster named Zikomo, who wants them to return his, of all things, drum (dhol). Watch how the foursome attempt to hilariously wiggle out of this tough spot even as the Police, Martand's uncle and other goons close in on them.",
