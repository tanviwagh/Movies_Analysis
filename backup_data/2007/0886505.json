        "In advent of the new millennium in modern day India; hardships takes an heavy toll on its inhabitants with little means of survival forcing these individuals to migrate to other countries in order to sustain their families. An agent, Rashid Khan attempts to make this possible albeit illegally with promises to take 200 inhabitants from all states of India as well as a merger amount from Bangladesh and Pakistan to a country of their choice which in this case is Great Britain. These people mortgage their entire life savings with Rashid as they prepare to travel only to open up a means of struggle between life and death en-route. Things worsen when they board a ship where a huge amount is killed in a huge storm save for a limited amount. They do land on shore where a chain of events led them to an Afghanistan guide, Palvisha. When Palvisha is at the threshold of life - they are save by Sameer who takes over as their guide by gaining their trust but their nightmare does not end when they are taken to Pakistan and jailed as Sameer is not what he claims to be and now starts to show his true colors.::gavin (racktoo@hotmail.com)"
