Years later Devdhar has matured, returns home so that Radha could get married. He meets with and falls in love with Bade Thakur's paternal niece, Manorama, his childhood friend.

A few months later he meets with Radha, who is now pregnant, and also decides to visit his uncle and aunt.

What Devdhar does not know is that Manorama also carries a dark secret - which if revealed will bring death and bloodshed to this small region.",

He returns after his studies, to find that Manorama has grown up into a beautiful young lady, and falls in love with her.
