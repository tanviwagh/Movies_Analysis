    "plot outline": "Nandagopal (Narain ) lives with his mother (Geetha) and mute sister Maya (Remya Nambeeshan) at the mercy of his uncle (Janaradhanan). They come to know their late father (Lal) bought a bungalow in Kalimuthupalayam, Tamil Nadu. Nandagopal go there to sell the property in order to get over their financial difficulties. But it's not easy to sell the bungalow because Nachiappa Gounder (Rami Reddy), the villain, refuses to vacate the house. In the meanwhile the Nandu falls in love with Chembakam (Pooja). This matter creates other problems. Nandu's friends decide to bring his mother and sister to stay in the house. When his mother comes and sees the house, she is shocked. For there is a story from the past that she remembers and that Nandagopal doesn't know. Finally Nandhu comes to know that all this cruelty of Gounder towards his family was only a part of enmity that roots back in the past. The rest of the movie is about how Nandagopal confronts with the Nachiappa Gounder. The rest of the film is based on these events",
