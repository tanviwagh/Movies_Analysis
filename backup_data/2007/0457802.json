    "synopsis": "Based on a novella by Rushkin Bond, and set in the picturesque Himachal Pradesh, Chatri Chor tells the story of the turmoil caused in a small village, by a blue umbrella that Biniya (Shreya Sharma), a young village girl obtains from a Japanese tourist in exchange for her lucky charm necklace carrying two bear claws. The resulting jealousy and possessiveness drive the village shopkeeper Nandakishore (Pankaj Kapur) to desperation. Eventually the umbrella is stolen, and within a few days, a red umbrella arrives for Nandkishore by post, and with this, he regains the respect of the villagers. Once it turns out that this was the very same blue umbrella of Biniya, the villagers boycott Nandkishore, who then tries real hard to win back the goodwill of the society. Will he ever be forgiven and redeemed?"
