    "plot outline": "Deepa lives a poor lifestyle along with her widowed father, and is in love with Dharma. Her father becomes ill, and must re-locate abroad for treatment. A rich male, Singh, offers to marry Deepa and only then will he get her dad the required treatment. Deepa agrees, and a heartbroken Dharma decides to remain single, takes to alcohol and becomes a goon. Deepa gives birth to a daughter, Barkha, but her husband passes away leaving her very wealthy. Her ex-convict brother-in-law, Bhanupratap, demands cash, and she gives him some, but he wants more, and upon being refused - kills her, moves in along with his wife, Shanti; son, Roshan; and daughter, Chandni; on the pretext of looking after Barkha. He hopes to take over the entire estate, but finds his plans foiled when he finds out that Deepa had left a Will which made it mandatory for the entire estate to be transferred to Barkha after she reaches the age of 21. He and his wife abuse Barkha, force her to give up her studies, and make her do all the household work while they continue to collect a princely allowance every month. Years later Barkha has grown up, and after being whipped by her uncle, manages to escape, meets and falls in love with a street-wise male, Suraj. Ironically, Bhanupratap hires Dharma, who locates and takes her back - leaving her no choice but to sign-over the entire estate to her uncle.",
