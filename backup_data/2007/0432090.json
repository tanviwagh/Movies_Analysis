Mahalaxmi (Gowri Munjal ) is the daughter of Somaraju. Somaraju dearly loves his daughter. Bunny (Allu Arjun) joins the same college as Mahalaxmi. He impresses Mahalaxmi on the first day itself.

The rest of the story explains why Bunny asks for Somaraju's property. Bunny's real father is Mahalaxmi's mom's brother. He was a great man with lots of land and property, as well as lots of regard from the government and other people. When Mahalaxmi is born, Mahalxmi's mom asks him to perform the baby naming ceremony and such. On his way there, Somaraju attacks him with the help of a bunch of rowdies. They pretty much kill him and leave him to die in the forest. However, he manages to live and perform Mahalaxmi's ceremony, but he dies minutes after, without telling anyone what happened. Bunny comes to know of this when his so-called father explains to him that he is really his godfather and not his father. While trying to save him, his godfather and godmother give up their own son to keep him alive. To regain his rightful property, Bunny fights Somaraju and he wins his girl.",
