Thara Kurup (Kavya Madhavan) is the daughter of the Member of the state Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Muvattupuzha; she is a dancer who regularly wins awards for the college with her performances.It was Murali's dream to have a ten-year reunion, but he mysteriously dies before the reunion can be organised.
