        "Tito and Tony are room-mates who live a poor lifestyle in a rental room owned by Tito's girlfriend's dad. Both manage to sneak into the room late every night as they barely make enough by taking photographs to pay the rent. One day they are hired by Bonny Singh to act as spies on a number of people, including Babu Karela, Amru, Tejpal, and Makrana, for a hefty fee, to which they agree. They attempt to spy on these people but when Makrana, then Tejpal, and then Amru end up being killed, the duo start questioning their employer - little knowing that his real name is Karan - an escaped convict, who was arrested, tried in Court, and found guilty of killing his wealthy girlfriend, Anju Khanna.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
