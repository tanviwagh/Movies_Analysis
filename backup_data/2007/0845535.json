However, if prodigious talent, passion, and attitude are considered synonymous with the music industry, then Reggi fits the bill. Young and hugely talented, he craves A.J.'s spot at the top. Into these lives enter two women: aspiring singer Ruhi and ambitious P.R. professional Sheena. Ruhi has much professional respect for A.J., but she has been wooed and won over by Reggi. Sheena, on the other hand, holds a grudge against Reggi because, while she did a lot for him as a PR, he had rejected her in a personal relationship. As A.J. and Reggi face off against each in a do-or-die battle, envy and betrayal rear their ugly heads, and talent struggles to survive the onslaught of a carefully-orchestrated smear campaign.",

        "A tale of two different musicians, dramatically different but united in their passion for music, set against the backdrop of the international music industry.",

Leo Rahman",
        "The movie revolves around two men with a similar passion: music. AJ (Bobby Deol) plays a ruthless guy with a manipulative frame of mind; he has gotten where he is through sheer dint of hard slog. He's used to winning; he revels in it and will never let anybody overtake him. Reggi (Upen Patel) is a talented up-and-coming singer who is struggling hard to get noticed. Young and hugely talented, he hungers for what AJ has, he craves to be where AJ is. Ruhi (Kangana Ranaut) is an aspiring singer who looks up to AJ but has fallen head-over-heels for Reggi. Sheena (Celina Jaitley) is a gorgeous, ambitious PR professional who goes all out to promote Reggi. There is a lot of drama in this part of the flick as the story involves a lot of emotions all mixed into one musical drama: _Shakalaka Boom Boom_ (qv). Eventually, music emerges as the sole winner in the film.::hEmRaJ (gavin_coolhgr@hotmail.com)"
