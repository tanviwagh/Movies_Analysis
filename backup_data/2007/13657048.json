    "plot outline": "The film begins with Karthik (Harikumar) arriving in Bangalore to meet Priya (Mansi Pritam), with whom he had a six-month online friendship. Karthik then takes an elderly couple from an old-age home with him to be his parents. Karthik seduces Priya and asks her parents to marry her with the help of his new parents. Her parents who like his character accept and they get married. However, the next morning, Priya is shocked to see her newly-wedded groom had disappeared with her jewels and money. Her uncle Saravanan (Adithya), an assistant commissioner who is charged to catch Karthik, finally arrests him during his seventh wedding in Cochin. During the enquiry, Karthik falls into a coma and Saravanan finds in his things a prescription with the hospital address. Saravanan goes to the hospital and he meets doctor Shanmugam (Nassar) in Ooty. Shanmugam tells him everything. Karthik real name is Velmurugan, he was Shanmugam's car driver and he lived with his widowed mother (Priya) in Ooty. His mother wanted him to get married but all the women refused to marry him since he had a stammering mouth and an ugly looking face. Therefore, Velmurugan developed an inferiority complex. Vandana (Priyanka Nair), an aspiring house surgeon, came to Ooty for her training course and stayed in Shanmugam's house. Moved by Velmurugan's sad life, Vandana helped him to overcome the stammering problem and Velmurugan fell in love with her. One day, Vandana read his love letter and did not talk to him anymore. After her training, she left Ooty and returned home. Priya (Suja Varunee), one of the nurses working in the same hospital, promised Velmurugan that she will bring them together. However, Priya scammed him: she posed as Vandana on the phone and talked to the innocent Velmurugan, and she enjoyed life with his hard-earned savings. When he came to know about the scam, he was heartbroken. Thereafter, his mother died and he decided to end his life by falling into a ravine with his boss' car. A heavily wounded Velmurugan was brought to the hospital and Shanmugam treated him. Velmurugan who survived the accident began to suffer from horrible headaches. Velmurugan then underwent extensive plastic surgery on his face. Six months later, Velmurugan had become a handsome looking man and he successfully overcame his inferiority complex but he developed a superiority complex. Afterwards, Velmurugan became a psychopath and married around five women (all named Priya) and eloped on the very next day with their jewels and valuable belongings. Back to the present, Karthik manages to escape from the hospital and decides to go to Delhi to marry another girl name Priya but before, he bumps into the nurse Priya. When he tries to torture her to death, he becomes emotionally disturbed and faints. Admitted to the hospital, a worried Vandana comes to see Karthik who is suffering from heavy headaches and Karthik begs her to kill him to relieve him from pain and suffering. Feeling guilty for what happened to him, Vandana euthanizes him and she is arrested by the police.",
