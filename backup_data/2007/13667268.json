    "plot outline": "Raja (London Ravi) and Vinoth (R. V. Bharathan) hate each other after they got into a fight during a cricket match. They are now college students studying in the same class. Vinoth is a person with a rough personality but is also a talented drawer, whereas Raja is a soft and simple person. They both fall under the spell of their classmate Nila (Meghna) and befriend her. Raja changes his clothing habits and his character and even stops playing cricket for her. During a college trip to Kodaikanal, Raja takes care of the sick Nila and spends much time with her. One day, Vinoth reveals his love to Nila, but she chooses Raja as her lover. Vinoth then becomes a drunkard. After a serious bike accident, Nila is admitted to the hospital. Raja discovers he is now a ghost and died in the bike accident. Afterwards, Raja meets Chellappa (Manivannan), another ghost, who reveals to him that a ghost can be seen and can interact with a human only if the ghost wants. The loss of her lover makes Nila sad and depressive. She attempts to hang herself, but her family saves her in time. Raja, therefore, visits Vinoth's house and finds paintings of Nila in his room, so he decides to help Vinoth conquer Nila's heart. When Raja meets Vinoth on multiple occasions, Vinoth, afraid of him, ran away from him. One day, Raja tells Vinoth that he wants to help him and gives him good advice to woo Nila. After unsuccessful attempts to woo her, Vinoth completely changes his character and spends time with Nila. Vinoth then makes a marriage proposal to Nila, but she refuses to marry him. Nila considered Vinoth as a friend who wants to make her happy. She also said that she has no feelings for him and he behaves exactly like her deceased boyfriend Raja. Consumed with anger, Vinoth reveals to her that Raja is now a ghost and helped him woo her. Raja appears to Nila's eyes. He tries to convince her to move on and to marry Vinoth, but she categorically refused. Vinoth pushed Nila onto the railway tracks, and she died after being hit by a train. Vinoth explains to Nila, now a ghost, that he wanted her to be happy and that she can now be with her lover. The film ends with Raja and Nila walking hand in hand.",
