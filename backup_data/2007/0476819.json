Balram hires two waiters, Johnny and Jimmy, as Johnny is the brother of his deceased Accountant, Ram Prasad Gupta; while Jimmy was hired at the behest of a politician from Bihar. When Balram finds out that both Johnny and Jimmy are here because they had found out that he had embezzled a total of 30 Crores Rupees and want a share, he hires Dilher and his brothers, Hans, and Jazzy, to do away with them. Balram chooses to have them killed in scenic Mauritius, where Pooja's friend, Kim, also runs a hotel. When Dilher finds out about the 30 Crore embezzlement, he asks his brothers to get the money, kill Balram and ensure that Johnny and Jimmy get the blame. Things get way out of control when Hans and Jazzy find out that Balram is virtually indestructible and may well expose the trio for attempting to kill him. Watch how Johnny and Jimmy take advantage of this situation and do their bit to find and keep the 30 Crore amount for themselves.",
