    "plot outline": "Thangapaandi (S.J. Suryah) is the son of Mannachaami, who is financially mediocre but well respected and loved in the Tirunelveli village. Thangapaandi is immature and spends his time gallivanting about the village and dancing at temple functions, while failing his plus two examinations with regularity every year. His niece Rasathi (Preethi Varma) is in love with him, as their parents have informally promised them to each other from childhood itself. However, Thangapaandi pursues his own agenda and falls for loud-mouthed orphan girl Ayyakka (Meera Jasmine), who makes and sells pots for a living. Thangapaandi, despite his lack of a regular job or prospects, appears to be the most sought after bachelor in the village. In the midst of this love 'square', the elders add their own two cents of interference, causing more chaos. How Thangapaandi and his ladies deal with this is the fodder for the rest of the film.",
