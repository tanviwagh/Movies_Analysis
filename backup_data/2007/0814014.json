        "Indian-based boxer Baldev Singh Choudhary lives with his wife Raavi, daughter Pooja, and sons Angad and Karan. Baldev travels to the U.S to boost his boxing career, but unfortunately things don't go in his favor when he's placed before the court on drug charges and banned from boxing. Upon his return to India, Baldev attempts to redeem himself by coaching Angad in boxing, but Angad isn't interested; he doesn't consider boxing a profession or think it can sustain a family. Baldev loses faith in him. 10 years later, Baldev sees a chance in the form of a TV ad to coach a young aspiring boxer named Gaurav Ghera. Unfortunately, Guarav leaves him, and his younger son Karan, who lost the use of one arm in a childhood accident, to give up his music career for boxing. The qualifying match is with Gaurav; Karan manages to qualify himself, prompting his dad to take him to the U.S for the World Heavyweight Champion match facing runner-up Luca Gracia. Karan is badly bagged, severely injured and hospitalized. Angad then rises to the occasion to give his father the surprise of a lifetime.::gavin (racktoo@hotmail.com)",
        "Former boxer Baldev Chaudhary lives a retired life in his village in India. He was falsely accused of doping charges and had to quit the sport. He challenges that elder son Angad will win the boxing championship someday and regain his pride. Baldev trains Angad hard but he quits the sport in favor of supporting his family, creating a feud between father and son. Angad's younger son Karan can't step into the ring as one of his hands has been immobile since a childhood accident. Bladev gets a ray of hope when younger boxer Gaurav considers having him as a coach, and things are going well until Guarav ditches him for an International coach. Baldev's dreams are shattered again, but suddenly Karan's hand gets better, and he agrees to train for the boxing championship. He manages to reach the final match against the world heavyweight champion Luca Gracia, who manages to overcome him by cheating--and badly damages Karan's liver. Angad flies to the US where he finds from Karan how Luca cheated to win the match. Angad bashes Luca in public and challenges him to a match which would give the pride back to his family, much to chagrin of Baldev.::alex.mjacko@gmail.com",
        "Baldev Singh Choudhary lives a poor lifestyle in Kiratpur, Punjab with his wife Raavi, sons Angad and Karan, and daughter Pooja. His passion is boxing, so he virtually abandons his family and relocates to America. In his absence, Karan gets into an accident and ends up disabled, unable to use his left arm. The children grow up, Baldev returns home, after first being honored with a silver medal, but subsequently banned from boxing after testing positive for drug abuse. He swears to avenge this humiliation by training Angad to be a world-class boxer. But Angad has other plans, like building a house, opening his own business, getting Pooja married to U.S.-based Saket, and looking after his wife Simran and their son; he openly denounces boxing as a worthless sport. Embittered by his son's refusal, Baldev decides to find someone else, and he does: Gaurav Ghera. He enthusiastically trains Gaurav, only to be betrayed by him. How will Baldev avenge his humiliation?::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
