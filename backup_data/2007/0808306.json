There are old-timers Nahid & Oscar on their second marriages, reflective and forgiving of live. Then there's the Gujrati couple Hitesh and Shilpa who can't get anywhere near each other without scrabbling, the super-compatible Parsi couple Aspi and Zara, and the oddball NRI husband Bunty with his desi, fun-loving wife Madhu. An uptight and insecure Bengali man, Partho, is very much in love with his beautiful, free-spirited wife Milly. And rounding off the sextet are the Kapoors, the Punjabi couple comprising of talkative Pinky and contemplative Vicky. The film starts off with the start of the bus journey, and a couple of red herrings, like Shilpa crying her eyes out at going on the honeymoon. Then there's an opinionated bus driver, and a mysterious motor-bike rider following the bus. And while everything looks lovey-dovey in the beginning, with familiarity and time, problems crop up. How each couple deals with their own specific problems is the rest of the film.::Amodini's Movie Reviews (http://hindimoviereviews.blogspot.com)",
        "Wearing rather thick prescription eye-glasses, Aspi lives in the Dadar Parsi Colony, and is terrified of going to school as he gets picked on. He assists another beleaguered student, Zara, and after being hit by Hailey's comet, their respective visions improve so much that they discard their eye-glasses, become friends, grow up and get married. After Oscar's wife kills herself, leaving him to look after his daughter, Gina and son, Ricky, he gets married to Nahid, his business partner's wife, after he and their two daughters die in an accident. Gujarati-speaking Shilpa is forced to get married to Hitesh while she is in love with a poor youth, Jignesh. Punjabi-speaking, Chandigarh-born, talkative Pinky's dreams come true when she gets to marry her sweetheart, Delhi-born, Vicky Kapoor. Bengali-speaking conservative Partho Sen gets married to a seemingly coy, Milly. Non-resident Indian, Bunty, gets married to Madhu, who he met via the Internet, after Madhu finds that her lover of many years, Sanjay Bapat, is not only already married but also has a child. The lives of these five couples interline during their honeymoon bus trip to Goa, and this is where secrets will be revealed, exposing the lack of compatibility as well as a dark side that they had never known of their respective spouses.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
