    "plot outline": "Shankar Ayya(Saravanan) is the 'godfather' of Tuticorin and the villages around it, where the Arivaal( sickle used as a weapon to kill) culture prevails. The villagers respect him because of his stature as a do-gooder and a man who helps the poor and needy. His enemies led by his cousin Semmarai Pandian, a cruel and cunning man with a nose ring (Sudhakar Vasanth) hate him due to decades old enmity between the two families. So blood flows as frequent gang wars take place, creating a law and order problem in the coastal area. The Superintendent of Police, Veerasangili (Deepan Chakravarthy) is asked by the government to sort out and stop the gang wars. Remember the earlier SP had disappeared, trying to bring the feud to an end.(actually he was chopped and his body was disposed of in the deep sea by Semmarai and his gang!) Veerasangli is a more committed man, and he tries to negotiate peace, but fails to bring Semmarai to the table, even after threatening him with encounter death. Semmarai with a pathological hatred for Shankar is obstinate that he will never allow peace as long as Shankar family holds sway, and then plays dirty. What happens next is told in a compelling and gripping manner, leading to a stunning climax.",
