    "plot outline": "Marudhu (Mahadevan) and Kaliammal (Saranya Ponvannan) are a rich couple who have no child. They adopt Kannan (Prabha), a young man from a lower caste. However, Kannan feels depressed to leave his parents and little sister for his new family. Kannan, Marudhu and Kaliammal then leave their place for Kaliammal's native village. In Kaliammal's village, some villagers start to talk ill about Kannan's caste. Kaliammal's brother Shankarapandi (Shanmugarajan), a politician and a caste fanatic, hates Kannan and fears that Kannan would receive his sister's inheritance. In the meantime, Shankarapandi's daughter Padma (Karthika Adaikalam) falls in love with Kannan, whereas Kannan and Meera (Priya Mohan) fall in love with each other. Thinking that his daughter and Kannan were in love with each other, Shankarapandi now wants Kannan to be his son-in-law. When Shankarapandi visits their home for the engagement, Kannan refuses to marry her; thus Shankarapandi felt humiliated. Padma's suicide attempt makes the situation worse. Shankarapandi has a bad name among his caste people. To win the local election, he needs their support, and only Marudhu can help him. However, Marudhu refuses to help him and hates his view about the caste system. Meanwhile, Kannan is sick of this situation and leaves his home without informing his adoptive parents. A few days later, Marudhu and Kaliammal go to Meera's home to bring Kannan home, but he was not there. That night, Marudhu and Kaliammal are killed in a car explosion. Meera witnesses it, but she is hit by a car. When Kannan returns home to perform the last rites for his adoptive parents, Shankarapandi humiliates him and is hell bent on performing the rites, thus receiving his sister's inheritance. Meera, who was in the hospital, tells Padma about the whole incident and blames Shankarapandi for the murders. Padma then orders Kannan to punish her father. An angry Kannan beats him up and tells Shankarapandi that money and caste do not matter to him. Meera takes a burning stick and gives it to Padma (Meera symbolically sacrifices her love). Padma then cremates the dead bodies. The film ends with Kannan leaving the place in tears and Padma following him.",
