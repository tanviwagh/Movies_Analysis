    "plot outline": "Irfan Khan Iliyazi, the son of a railway coolie, was born in Bombay, who started his career as a pick-pocket. At the age of 17, he killed his opponent and scattered his body parts on nearby railway tracks. He then went on to become an gangster as well as started dealing in drugs, narcotics, and acquiring multiple identities/passports from Mumbai, Indore, and Sultanate of Oman. On August 10 the Mumbai Police had him cornered at the airport while attempting to flee to Dubai, but Irfan escapes and re-locates to Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. Once there, he plans his escape by disguising himself and arranging the hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane to Kathmandu, Nepal, and thence making his way to Dubai. The Indian Police announce they will reward anyone who apprehends this fugitive dead or alive. Everything goes according to plan - until Irfan gets on the plane. This is where he will end up getting abducted by four naive and inexperienced youth - who want to better their individual lives - by holding him hostage and claim the reward anonymously. Watch what happens when the police are mobilized to counter this abduction.",
