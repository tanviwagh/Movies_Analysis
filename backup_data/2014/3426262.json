        "The story is single layered and revolves around a car. A village Pannaiyar or landlord (Jayaprakash) takes a liking for a Fiat Premier Padmini car that has been left in his care by a friend. Pannaiyar falls in love with the car and appoints Murugesan (Vijay Sethupathi) a tractor driver as his personal driver. Soon the car becomes an all-purpose vehicle for the villagers. But for Pannaiyar, his wife Chellamma (Thulasi) and Murugesan, the car is a like a family member. Due to unavoidable circumstances the car is taken away leaving them heartbroken.::Surya Kumar",
        "A magnanimous village head falls head-over-heels for a Premier Padmini car that was given to him temporarily by his brother, when the latter goes out of town for a few days. The car becomes the cynosure not only for the village head, his wife, and the driver, but for the whole village, which celebrates the car as their own. Whether the village head gets to keep the car for himself without parting with it to his brother or his selfish daughter forms the rest of the story.::PipingHotViews"
