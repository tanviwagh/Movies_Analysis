        "Venkateswarulu(Gopichand) a wayward guy helps his friend to elope with his lover from her brother Babji(Sampath) who is a dangerous don in Warangal. Knowing this his father Puppy(Chandramohan) drives him away from house. Venky started staying with his friend(Satyam Rajesh). One day he falls in love with Chandrakala (Rakul Preet Singh). But he gets to know that she is sister of Babji. How Venky will win his love forms the crux of the story::krishna vamsi",
        "This story begins with Sampath, who is very protective of his two sisters, realizing that the older one has eloped with his rival, Mukesh. Gopichand helps her run off, with the help of Brahmanandam, a taxi driver. Then he moves to Warangal where he meets Rakul Preet, and falls in love with her. Sampath, meanwhile, starts to hunt for Gopichand, finding out that he was in Warangal through Brahmanandam. To torture Gopichand, Sampath kidnaps Brahmanandam and Gopichand's father as well as Rakul Preet, forcing him to return to Hyderabad. Gopichand then saves Rakul Preet, who explains to him about the Rivalry between Sampath and Mukesh, and Gopichand realizes that Rakul Preet was Sampath's younger sister. She also tells him that the only way he can truly be with her is if he sorts the issues out between Sampath and her older sister, as well convince Sampath of their love. Gopichand then sets out on a series of hilarious twists and turns and he tries to convince Sampath to let go of old grudges and accept his sisters' choices.::Shrinivas G. Kulkarni"
