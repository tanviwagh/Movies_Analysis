As typical teenagers, their favourite pastime is either pulling pranks on people or bunking classes to find new spots to hangout at. On one such expedition, Manjiri bumps into a girl in the middle of nowhere. When she comes back with the others, the girl is disappeared. No one believes her. One day, Manjiri and Ajay run into Bhura (Ankush Chaudhary), and suspect some foul play in the area. The group encounter a safe house where they find young innocent kids being held. Their professor Shraddha (Sai Tamhankar), explains the issue of child trafficking to them which sparks an urge of helping the kids in the youngsters' minds. Things don't go as planned and one of them gets caught.",
