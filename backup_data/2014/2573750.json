        "A fearless woman fights social injustice; creating a sanctuary for abused women and battling a crooked politician.",
        "Rajjo has created an ashram (sanctuary) for girls and women. The youngest students are taught to read. The adults are given a chance for employment, grounding spices, weaving beautiful pink saris, and when necessary picking up weapons to fight social injustices. Rajjo and her rose-hued gang members are asked to back Sumitra Bagrecha, a politician whose grand promises inspire hope in Rajjo.

        "Hardened by the atrocities of her stepmother and social injustices at a very young age, Rajjo (Madhuri Dixit) opens up a pink ashram named _Gulaab Gang_ (qv). _Gulaab Gang_ (qv) is an all-women gang which focuses on fighting social injustices against women, poverty and issues like rape, dowry and education for girls. Whenever there is an issue which cannot be resolved by talking it out, Rajjo and her gang go out with their axes, sickles and batons to beat the men and bring them to their senses. Rajjo's real struggle begins when a corrupt, manipulative and greedy female politician, Sumitra Devi (Juhi Chawla) comes into the picture. Sumitra has no qualms about using people, including Rajjo and her gang, to fulfill her political aspirations. Rajjo has never faced an enemy so venomous and two-faced like Sumitra. Will Rajjo be able to combat Sumitra or will Sumitra succeed in fulfilling her political ambitions by crushing Rajjo and her gang?"
