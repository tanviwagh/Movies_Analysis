        "An Indian actress, Doel Mitra, shoots to overnight infamy igniting the wrath of conservative Indian Society when a bold scene from one of her foreign films is leaked on the internet. When the public scandal happens Doel is shooting an Indian Film where she plays the mythological Hindu character Sita, ''Ramayana''. Sita, considered the epitome of chastity and purity is ironically now being represented by a woman branded as a 'porn star'. Just like with Doel, Sita's moral fiber too was questioned by a hypocritical Indian Society which denounces her as 'fallen' due the threat of her sexuality.::Anonymous"
