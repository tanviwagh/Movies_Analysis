        "Kalidasan (Prakash Raj), an archaeologist is a chronic bachelor and is a born gourmet. Gowri (Sneha) is a dubbing artiste, who loves cooking which she had picked from her mother. Due to a wrong call, they converse and soon realize their love for 'kutty dosa'.

        "Kalidasa works in the state archaeological department and is a food lover. He has a beautiful home, but no romantic companionship - just a brotherhood of sundry fellows he collects in the course of the film - a relative, a cook, a tribal leader and his nephew. When Kalidasa receives a misdialed phone call from Gowri, a voiceover artiste, the initial irritation gives way to a mutual attraction. However both parties shy away from their first face-to-face meeting, and decide to send younger, better-looking substitutes instead. By the end of the film, four people find love where they least expect it. Elements of South Indian life and culture, particularly cuisine, add depth and flavor to this poignantly sweet story."
