        "CBI officer Reet Oberoi sought assistance from a jail convict Professor Aman Varma to bring Lajja Shankar Pandey; a religious fanatic to justice. Pandey is responsible for abducting children and sacrifice them. But Aman is not willing to co-operate with Reet and instead scuffs at her which leads her into serious problems not only by the police but with some public personalities and the parents of the children affected by Pandey's behavior.::gavin (racktoo@hotmail.com)",
        "Police in India are baffled over the case of missing children, who bodies are later found dead. The case is assigned to the Central Bureau of Investigation, who entrust this matter to the care of CBI Officer, Reet Oberoi (Preity Zinta). Through extensive investigation Reet finds that the assailant is Lajja Shankar Pandey (Ashutosh Rana), a religious fanatic, undettered by the attention he has generated over the child killings, he continues to abduct children, and subsequently sacrifice them. In order to get more information about Pandey and his behaviour, Reet interviews and then seeks the help of a jailed convict, Professor Aman Varma (Akshaye Kumar), and because of this unconventional approach, she runs into problems, not only with the jail authorities, the local police; the home ministry; and Professor Varma himself. Things get worse when the only child of the Home Minister is abducted by Pandey, and Reet is asked to let go of this investigation.::rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)"
