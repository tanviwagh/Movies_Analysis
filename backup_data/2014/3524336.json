        "The film revolves around the lives of two people: a wealthy man in the construction business who has an affair with his subordinate, even though he is preparing to be engaged to his family friend's daughter; and a slum-dweller who works in a supermarket doing odd jobs who is mocked for his appearance and has a crush on his co-worker. The movie explores how these lives become interconnected by a bizarre sequence of events.::Santhosh"
