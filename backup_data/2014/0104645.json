        "In the arid region of Rajasthan, India; there are two royal families, Mirtagarth and Surjangarh who believes in a religious ritual which states that a warrior from each of these two families will come together annually to have a fierce battle with the winner having to sacrifice a baby buffalo and it will rain in that person's territory. This tradition must be fated to carry on by the future generation as it is a rule of nature set down by their kin.::gavin (racktoo@hotmail.com)"
