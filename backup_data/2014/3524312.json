    "plot outline": "Karthik (Richard) gets a call from his friend Kathir (Parthy) who explains to him that he had earlier that day received a call that his fianc\u00e9e, Isha (Vidhya Mohan), has cancelled her flight. Kathir had followed her and discovered that she had checked out a room in a local hotel, after which Kathir rents out the room across the hall from Isha believing she is cheating on him. Kathir explains to Karthik that, earlier that evening, he had gone to Karthik's house, and finding him not home, broke in and stole Karthik's gun. Worried that Kathir is about to kill someone, Karthik tries to reason with Kathir on the phone not to do anything, but after having no success, he tells Kathir to stay where he is and wait until he meets him at the hotel in about 20 minutes. During the film, it is revealed that Isha had canceled her flight because of Karthik and that they were cheating behind Kathir's back. Kathir finds this out when he kills Isha and tries to call Karthik, whose cell phone was still in the hotel room that Isha and Karthik cheated in. Kathir tricks Karthik into helping move Isha, framing him for killing her while the police storm the hotel.",
