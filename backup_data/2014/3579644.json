Bhanu's pleas for mercy as he is interrogated by a local police unit, introduces an uncanny atmosphere. Thus begins the story of Bhanu, accused of assaulting a young woman named Jyoti, who recites his life story to the chief policeman, surrounding the events leading to his arrival at Kolkata where he was employed at a road side food stall. It turns out that Bhanu had fallen hopelessly in love with Jyoti, who worked as a domestic aid at a swanky complex nearby. The love of true and the feelings blossoming in the heart of Bhanu for Jyoti were sweet. However, somewhere else, a darker side of love comes to light as Raj, a rich spoilt brat utilizing his material excess to woo Shreya, both of whom resided at a ritzy apartment building in close proximity to Bhanu's fast food cart. Initially, Raj and Shreya started establishing a strong bond. Raj showered Shreya with material excess, and later revealed his dark desires; recording a lewd video on his cell phone. As Raj and Shreya confront over the matter, things get out of control. The situation soon leads to crisis as an innocent is injured over the duet's feud. The true face of the uptown society, with shady details well omitted come to the foreground. Several questions arise. Is the upstanding society a safe heaven? Or is it a darker place than a gruesomely dark lane at night?",
