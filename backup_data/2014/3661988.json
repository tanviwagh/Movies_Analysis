        "David Abraham IPS is a 42 year old Middle aged suspended crime branch officer from Kerala Police department. Even though David Abraham is in suspension he engages himself in the investigation of a case which is not yet recorded in the crime records.::Nithin J",
        "The story starts with a monologue by David Abraham, IPS (Prithviraj) during the night of Christmas. When he leaves a party, he gets involved in an accident with Shan(Vinay Forrt) and Vinu(Anu Mohan). David takes them to the hospital to treat Vinu's injury which he sustained while falling off the bike. From the hospital Vinu escapes, to Shan's horror. David starts to suspect that there is something wrong. But Shan says there is no problem and David drops him at his place. Then he notices that Vinu has dropped his wallet in his jeep. Shan recounts the story of his friends - Eby(Tovino Thomas), Jessica aka Jessy (Janani Iyer), Cycle(Praveen Prem) and Vinu. Vinu runs an internet cafe. Cycle is the son of a gulf-returnee with a lot of financial problems. Shan is a local correspondent for a newspaper. Eby and Jessica grew up together in an orphanage, and Vinu has a special interest for Jessica and Jessica to him. One day, Vinu's internet cafe is raided by the police looking for some stuff. Since they couldn't find anything, the police returns without saying anything to Vinu. That night, Vinu's house is raided by a goon named Charlie(Yog Japee), who is commissioned by Christopher to locate a missing sum of Rs. 1.75 crores. They suspect that Vinu took the money from them and gives 36 hours to surrender the money to him. Later David receives a call from a local travel agent that someone has given him a fake note of thousand rupees to book a bus ticket to Bangalore. David catches him from the bus and it turns out it is Cycle who was trying to get out of the town. Using Cycle, David locates his other friends - Vinu and Jessica. Eby is nowhere to be seen. David asks Vinu to recount the happenings of the night of his suicide. Though at first he tells them a lie, under pressure Vinu tells David that Ebby had planned everything and stole the cash so he could kill Vinu because of his secret love for Jessica, but Jessica and Cycle were hearing all this. Jessica said she could not forgive him for trying to kill Vinu. With guilt Ebby tells them that the money is in the vehicle and commits suicide by jumping of the waterfall. Coincidentally Ebby's blood group was the same as Vinu's and they both had the same tattoo, so they decide to use Ebby's suicide to fake Vinu's death. After their confession David reveals that Ebby was a carrier for Christopher and the money in the bag was grade one counterfeit cash. David gave them the option of either leaving the money on the table so that he can report it as an abandoned bag of counterfeit money and that no one would ever disturb them about it or arrest them and take them to the court for planned murder. They chose the first option and handed the money over to David and left. When they left, however, Shan stops the car and questions the true identity of David Abraham, and the simple option given to them. They have a light-bulb realization to what was going on."

    "synopsis": "The story begins on the night of Christmas eve with a colorful spectrum of lights from a party revealing Pritviraj (David) enjoying a drink. After a while, he leaves in his jeep along the winding roads of ooty, narrating his views on crime and justice. He takes his eye off the road for a second to adjust his rearview mirror and gets into an accident with a bike in front of him, knocking them over. The two riders (Shaan and Vinu) get angry and when they notice their bike won't start, they have no choice but to take a ride in the jeep.They go to a hospital and after a small wait outside, Shaan and David are told by a nurse that Vinu has gone missing. Shaan, after hearing this goes insane for some unknown reason shouting his name all over the place, getting angry at David as well. They decide to look around, asking locals with a photo. Later in the jeep, David says he's an IPS officer which shocks Shaan and the former says everything is alright and gets off at his house and David leaves. We see David getting into his jeep from the same pub (from the introduction) and finding a wallet in which he sees Vinu's driver's license after which he leaves the area.In the next scene we see Vinu writing a suicide note and being emotional. He then jumps off the top of a waterfall and crashes below dying.\nDavid goes searching for Vinu from the address on his license.

Shaan, Vinu and Eby get together and try to figure this out and nobody has a clue about it. Cyril enters a few moments later and apologizes saying that he took the money and explains how he found it below a computer table at the internet caf\u00e9 that night when he was cleaning up; and how he came back later that night and hid the bag of cash in an abandoned part of his Dads tea factory. Later the next morning they go back to the tea factory and find out that the bag is empty and they all get angry at cyril for all the mess. They decide to stay at a lodge and relocate their families to a safer place; Vinu and Shaan leave the guys and carry on in their van later in the night. We then see a vehicle from behind with full headlights approaching fast and they bump the back of the van causing an accident; the guys in the car being Charlie and his gang.

David sees a phone number of a hospital on Vinus license and goes to investigate at the hospital with no luck; proceeding to the official hospital lab finding that Vinu came there to test some blood that was tampered with and was denied. David then investigates an illegal lab nearby and finds out that Vinu had tested many different blood samples there, and then the former takes the records and leaves. He then goes to the senior police officer (Victor from the previous raid) to talk about the case; telling him that Vinu was looking for the same blood type as his, a rare O ve and had visited the mortuary. The next day, David investigates at the mortuary and finds out from an employee that he saw another employee giving a body away for an illegal fee and confirming that Vinu was the one who took it away. The officer phones David telling him about various huge sum withdrawals from Vinus account. David then goes to the forensic examiner for Vinus body who tells him that the body was no doubt Vinus.
