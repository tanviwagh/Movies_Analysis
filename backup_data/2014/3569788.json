        "This fresh and bold psychological drama delves into the subject of Narcolepsy, a rare neurological sleep-disorder that alters normal sleep patterns, and induces sleep in those suffering from the illness, especially when they experience heightened emotions such as anger, love, hatred, sorrow, and pain. Indra is a normal young man with many dreams and ambitions, but every aspect of his life is hindered by the seemingly insurmountable obstacle of narcolepsy. How will he face the complexities brought about in his life by the illness? Will he succeed in protecting the love of his life and accomplish his goals despite the disorder?::Santhosh"
