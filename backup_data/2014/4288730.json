Raised by a father who cremated people for a living, Krishna's mother always wanted him to pave a path for himself that takes him away from the sorrows and hardship of his legacy. While his father's untimely death opens the gates of opportunity for young Krishna, the plight of his widowed helpless mother reels him back to his origins. Dhag captures the moments, trials and tribulations of young Krishna along the journey.",
