Lord Shiva shows three different episodes in a person's life, just by change of time and how the delay changes the whole situation. He illustrates his point through a kidnapping incident. Tamizh is asked to kidnap his lover Isabella (Ashrita Shetty) by her father's arch-rival in business as she is about to get married in a church. Tamizh is assisted by two other cons Malar (Bindhu Madhavi) and Isakki (Baghavathi).",
