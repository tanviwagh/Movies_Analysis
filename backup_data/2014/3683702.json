    "synopsis": "India is a young country, where the youth are increasingly becoming independent and taking charge of their own lives. Tapping into this bristling energy, we bring to you Fugly.A fast paced Masala Thriller with a social message, it set in the bylanes of Delhi. Miss a beat narrative, that would drive you to the edge of your seat in true blue Dilli ke rang! As they would say in DELHI Purra Da Purra Pomp and Show Kakke. Pulsating music, that is young, experimental and yet completely commercial Guaranteed to knock the knickers off anyone. Its whacky! Its Kitsch and it puts the best of friends through the most bizarre events of their life the game is FUGLY!"
