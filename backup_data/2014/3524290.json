Though they live in harmony with their job while having a fair share of fun and flirting with girls, they realize the need to make it big to lead a better life. With the goodwill of Aachi, their godmother and the help of market leader NKB, they set up a restaurant which gets them the identity they craved for. Unexpected turn of events push the boys the brink of failure and their fight to regain their identity forms the crux of the story.::PipingHotViews"
