        "Murali (Vinay) and his wife Madhavi (Andrea) goes to a village to sell their ancestral mansion. They are accompanied by over half-a-dozen family members (Raai Laxmi, Nithin Sathya, Kovai Sarala & Manobala). They discover some supernatural elements in the palace. Later, we get the answer to the question of why the ghost is haunting the place with a flashback where we are told about Selvi (Hansika), a young orphan who lived in the village priest's house, her romance with Murali and her unfortunate murder. Finally, Madhavi's brother Ravi (Sundar C) attempts to save Murali from the ghost of Selvi, which has now taken over Madhavi.::Suganth"
