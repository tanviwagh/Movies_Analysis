    "plot": "A young NSA agent is framed for the murder of his bosses making him realize that now his mission is darker than expected and has some personal scores to settle regarding his father's death, a former NSA agent.",
    "synopsis": "In the 1990s, 'Trinetra', a spy agency working under the RAW umbrella of India's secret services, is compromised due to a data breach by India's most dangerous terrorist organization, 'Al-Mujahideen'. The breach involves the leak of the identities of agents across India's secret services, the death of its best officer, Raghuveer, revelation of state secrets and ultimately, the shutdown of 'Trinetra'.\nPost the 26/11 attacks, the Prime Minister's Office realizes that India's war against terrorism isn't just at its borders, but also in the streets of its own cities. This results in renewed government interest in the 'Trinetra' program, the organization then reopens and recruits a group of people into the agency's ultra-competitive training program to choose one person as a spy, a 'Goodachari'. One of the recruits is a young man named, Arjun Kumar, the son of Trinetra's own martyr, Raghuveer. Arjun's passion to be like his father and serve his country manages to enlist him into the program but a sinister lurks for him, waiting. Arjun then gets framed in a way that he never imagined.\nA series of multiple assassinations of RAWs most elite members occur, with each incident containing evidence of Arjun's wrongdoing. Suddenly, Arjun, the wide eyed patriotic recruit becomes Trinetra's most wanted criminal.\nArjun then sets out on a journey to track down the people who are responsible for framing him, when he discovers information related a secret buried deep within his past, the secret about why his father was killed."
