In the family's single room - with a metal door an overseer bangs each day to call the workforce - there's a small plant the family calls its farm. The boss seems to appreciate Kavi's enthusiasm, but a beating is never far away. Besides pride in his industry, Kavi has dreams: to join other boys in a game of cricket and to go to school. His parents tell him it's not for him. Then, Kavi has a brief encounter with two men asking questions about the brickyard. What should Kavi do? How much should he risk?",
