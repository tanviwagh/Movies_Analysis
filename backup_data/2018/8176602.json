Tatu, a short tempered, irate middle-aged man living in a small village, is fascinated and curious to see a radio, a small portable transistor, for the first time in his life. Serendipitous circumstances allow him to possess a radio himself. The gadget makes his ordinary life full of excitement and fun. Tatu soon gets very attached to the radio, the newest member of his family. But nothing lasts forever. A sudden loss of the prized possession leaves Tatu disheartened and dejected. Refusing to accept this altered reality, Tatu embarks on a quest to reclaim what once belonged to him. Redu is a simple story of one man's life, love, values, and his will to go on, framed against the spectacular backdrop of rural Konkan.",
