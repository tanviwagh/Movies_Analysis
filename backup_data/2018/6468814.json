There is a goon named Selvam (Sayaji Shinde) who robs Kartikeya's machinery often. So Kartikeya's repeated complaints fall on deaf ear. So Karthikeya challenges that he can solve the case in 2 minutes, so the CI makes him CI for one day to fight Selvam. Kartikeya falls in love with a Choreographer named Pushpa (Raashi Khanna) after few silly talks and fights.One day after Irfan Lala (Freddy Daruwala) kills a student activist in a pub, Kartikeya's sister secretly watches it. She tells it to her brother. So Kartikeya informs this to police based on the picture of the criminal. So the police officer (Ajay) scolds Kartikeya that the criminal died long back ago. On the road suddenly Kartikeya watches Irfan going on road. He chases after him but the criminal gets missed.So kartikeya calls the commissioner of police (Murali Sharma) in Hyderabad and asks for Irfan Lala. There a flashback is revealed.Kartikeya is a dangerous, reckless, zero family emotions and duty dedicated cop who gets transferred from Kadapa to Hyderabad. He goes on a mission to save the daughter of the commissioner who is threatened by a gang to release their leader. Kartikeya goes and kills all of them and retrieves the girl safely.Irfan Lala and his father Rauf Lala (Shahbaaz Khan) are 2 Muslims hoping to win a by-election so that Irfan can become an M.L.A. So Irfan Lala does not let the CM of the state for rallying in his area called Muzaffarpet. Kartikeya tactically secures the CM'S rally and makes it successful and voting is also successful. Divya (Seerat Kapoor) loves him a lot. Her parents fix the engagement but Kartikeya breaks it due to an important mission. Divya gets hurt and she leaves him forever.During a party in an altercation, Irfan kills Shalini(Kaumudi Nemani). Shalini's mother (Suhasini Maniratnam) starts doing it on the road. It is revealed that Kartikeya was once the student of that Divya's mother. He promises to take action. So during a shootout he fatally wounds Irfan. During hospital he searches frantically for Irfan. But his father cools him down saying that Irfan is already dead. This is actually a drama played by both Kartikeya's father (Jayaprakash) and commissioner so that Kartikeya would be close to his family. Listening to all of this Kartikeya decides to draw balance between professional and personal life. So Kartikeya returns and kills Irfan Lala in a cool manner. Knowing this Irfan's father dies. The films ends with Karthikeya meeting Pushpa and requests for forgiving him and they both affectionally hug each other."
