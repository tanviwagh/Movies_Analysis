    "plot outline": "Kaattu Vithachavar is a political thriller based on the atrocities committed by the state of Kerala during the 21 months National Emergency, from 1975 to 1977. During this time, the government had suspended all the fundamental rights of the citizens. Many students and political opponents were imprisoned and tortured alleging Naxal allegiance. Among them was P Rajan, a final year student of the erstwhile Regional Engineering College, Calicut who was arrested by the police on March 1, 1976. When the Emergency was lifted in 1977, everyone was released but Rajan was never seen again. Rajan's father Eachara Warrier fought a long and historic crusade against the establishment to bring to light the facts behind Rajan's disappearance and expose the state's human rights violations. His fight for justice became a society's lament and created unprecedented turmoil in Kerala politics. The chief minister of the state who was in charge of the police during the Emergency was forced to resign because of an adverse legal judgment. Many high ranking police officers were prosecuted too. The film narrates an adapted story based on the police investigation against police, post the Emergency headed by then Kerala DIG Rajgopal Narayan to unravel what happened to Rajan. It introduces to the new generation a glorious part of Kerala history marked with fierce rebellion against social disparities, exploitation and human rights violations.",
