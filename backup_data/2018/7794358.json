        "A family entertainer, beautifully shot in Konkan, _Barayan_ (qv) is a visual treat. A story of a confused, lost, clueless 12th standard student 'Anirudh'. Everyone around him is bombarding with daily doses of 'Gyan'. Whether in 12th or you have passed out, all of us have gone through this _Barayan_ (qv). 12th standard, college life, entrance tests, hostel fun, family, friends and......'Anirudh'.

        "As the title suggests it is a story or rather 'Ramayan' that revolves around the year Baravi (12th Standard). Most of us in our school life are threatened by 12th standard board examination. The social surrounding of our society has given lot of importance to HSC thereby resulting in unnecessary burden on the student and putting performance pressure on him/her. Parent's also go with the flow and put unrealistic burden on the student. The overall education scenario has become very commercial. If the student does not perform in his 12th than he cannot do anything good with his/her life is a general perception. Traditional mindset of the society is that Medical or Engineering are the only two major career options. The film has subtly and in an 'entertaining manner' highlighted this aspect of our educational system. The story revolves around incidents based on 12th standard in the life of the protagonist Anirudh and his journey to engineering college after that. A story that unfolds various experiences of Anirudh, his learning during the process of him seeking education and identifying his ultimate interest. How his social surrounding is enabling him to grow as a person. The protagonist of the film represents today's student and the challenges faced by him to understand his passion. The story of the film is set in a serene and calm town of Konkan, surrounded by mesmerizing seashore and beautiful fort. It is purely a family drama."
