The public is on the fence over these killings. These crimes reflect Vir as a person. Bold, Calculating, and Unapologetic. He's not scared of killing, or dying. It was clear that he had an agenda.

He is up against Vir, who is a vigilante and will stop at nothing to complete his mission. This confrontation of epic proportions will take us through the corrupt underbelly of the Financial Capital. Vir and Shivansh are against the same enemy, but they are divided by a fine line. The Law. Shivansh is the \"good-guy\" protector of the law, whereas Vir wants to take matters into his own hands, disregarding the law. Were these meticulously planned murders just vengeance killings?
