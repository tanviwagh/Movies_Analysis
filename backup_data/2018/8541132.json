Ananth's guilty consciousness and his psychological state blur the line between reality and illusion. Sometimes he is unaware of what's happening in his life. As a parallel, Siddarth, a killer by profession wants to quit his job and be a free man. To be a free man he has to kill one more man. Who is that man whom he has to kill? Does he kill him? These questions pose symbolic questions such the confusions about identity of modern man. Thus, the movie narrates the story through colors and imagery. The movie deals with present day man's confusion about what to do (in life) and how to do in a symbolic way.",
