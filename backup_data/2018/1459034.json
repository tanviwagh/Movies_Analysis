Mudaliar is much loved and respected by people of his locality and Billu is almost like a foster son to every person in the locality. Billu takes an instant liking for Susi (Bhavana) the moment he sets his eyes on her at the railway station. Susi, who has arrived from Bangalore to Chennai, is all set to stay at Sait's (VMC Haneefa) place and Sait, who has worked for Susi's father Chidambaram (Lal), a dreaded thug, earlier, has changed ways but retains his respect towards him nevertheless. Susi, who has been craving for love and concern since young, gets impressed with the bonding that the Royapuram residents share. Love blooms between Susi and Billu, and just when they share a light moment with Billu's friends, the unexpected occurs.",
