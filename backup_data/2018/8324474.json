    "synopsis": "Set in present day, suburban city, 'Hope Aur Hum' is a simple, human story of a family. Nagesh (Naseerudin Shah) clings on to his youth with a space-consuming out-of-order photocopy machine. Once a state-of-the-art fine German engineering product, the machine now frequently visits the state of being 'out of order'. Nagesh claims to earn a living from it, but to anyone sane, it is obvious that he is just hoarding, calling it a memory. Everyone laughs at him, his family pesters him to get rid of it, but he wouldn't budge. Incidentally, the machine also raises space and room issues for his granddaughter Tanu.Nagesh's younger son Nitin (Naveen Kasturia) lives a comparatively lavish life in the city of gold aka Dubai and has a penchant for showing up uninformed. He finds a love interest under surprising consequences in a twist that is absolutely hilarious and leaves him sincerely baffled.Simultaneously, Anurag (Kabir Sajid), Nagesh's grandson, a jovial and active kid who loves to play cricket is forced by destiny to visit his grandmother's house that is far from the city. There, he encounters an interesting series of events that he is rather secretive about. As things go topsy-turvy for him, his experience turns traumatic and his general behavior shifts dimensions. He loses interest in everything, including his favorite game, cricket. While this change in Anurag doesn't go unnoticed by the family, the secret doesn't see the light either.As the three different generations with three different journeys struggle to find peace within, our story progresses to reveal how each member of the family responds to change and how hope brightens up their 'hum'."
