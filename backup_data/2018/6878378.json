Aryan, a chief strategist, and his team volunteer to find AK.AK lives happily with his wife Yazhini, who owns and manages an Indian restaurant. Their life is interrupted by a mission to trace a hacker, Natasha from Bulgaria, who is responsible for cracking the security codes of the plutonium weapons. There have already been three man-made seismic activities caused by the explosion of plutonium bombs. She is wanted by the Interpol, CIA, and terrorist groups around the world for her hacking skills. AK's mission is to secure Natasha, thereby preventing the two future seismic quakes targeted in India.AK goes back to Serbia in search of Natasha, where he is guided by APS (Arumai Prakasm), a local translator. He interrogates the hospital doctors in the city and finds that Natasha has undergone plastic facial alteration surgery. Meanwhile, an Albanian gang has hijacked Natasha's boyfriend and tortured him to death. With the help of the pacemaker found in her boyfriend's body, AK traces Natasha and moves her to a safe house.Natasha is unaware the code she decrepit was that of a nuclear weapon.

To stop AK from continuing his job, Aryan kidnaps AK's wife and keeps her in a secret place. He asks AK whether he will save his wife or stop the bomb. AK beats up Aryan and prevents the plutonium weapon from blasting.The movie ends with AK, Yazhini, and their child going for a long drive, when suddenly, a mission comes for AK."
