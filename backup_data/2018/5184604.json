Ghelo lives off of looting people by conducting raids during the dark hours in the surrounding villages. His three wives Monghi (Nandita Das), Dhanbai (Sujata Mehta), and Ratni (Sameera Avasthi) fail to deliver a child as the rains fail to soak the dry and arid terrain of the rocky lands of his native village. In his endeavor to prove his conviction that the rich and powerful (the landlord and the state) can only be contained by asserting power over them, Ghelo struggles through his life without love from his kin and without the support of his friends. Finally, out of desperation, he forcibly involves his newly made friend Pranjivan (Sandeep Kulkarni) in the raid (dhaad) of a wealthy landlord. The landlord's (Bhim Vakani) pregnant daughter (Pelva Naik) challenges Ghelo during the raid. Ghelo's conviction begins to melt away. His strength is drained out. What follows has to be seen to be believed.",
