        "Sandeep and Bikram are given punishment by their hockey coach as kids, following which Sandip quits the sport. Years later Bikram is a national-level player while Sandeep falls in love with Harpreet--also an hockey player--and rejoins the coaching academy. Harpreet and Sandeep fall in love, which doesn't please their coach, who is Harpreet's uncle and responds by abusing Sandeep. Bikram sees that Sandeep has a good potential of being a good flicker and tries his best to get him in the Indian hockey team. Sandeep becomes an ace hockey player known as Flicker Singh for his qualities. But at the peak of his career he is accidentally shot and left crippled. But his hopes don't die and he makes a triumph comeback.::alex.mjacko@gmail.com"
