The plot has Dr. Ajay Ghosh and his girl friend Protima working to improve the lives of Indian villagers, incurring the enmity of the local zamindar and his vicious, scheming henchman Sanatan. Ajay's relentless goodness eventually persuades the zamindar to bequeath his property to the hero, and general well-being reigns as class conflict is transmuted into class collaboration. The film includes the nationalist song 'Jai jai janani janmabhoomi' and other choruses with a similar thrust.",
