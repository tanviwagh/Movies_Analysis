    "synopsis": "Jay Gohil (Rahul Bhat) is a plant operator in a chromium sulphate plant named Apollo Chemicals and has been working there since 10 years. Digant is a new worker and was trained by Jay. During a periodic check up of the plant, the steam line leaked and Digant got hurt. Jay rushed to his superior Anand to ask for help. But Anand ignored telling him the injury is very minor. The workers soon left the plant after duty hours complaining how dangerous the plant has become. Their union leader Manoj also pays no attention to their problems.\nJay's son is very good in studies. He wants to see him as a doctor in the future. But he faces very difficulty in bearing household and son's educational expenses.\nThe following morning a worker (Prakash) who is also a very good friend of Jay fell unconscious in the plant. They took him to hospital and found out that he is suffering from cancer and is going to die soon. Digant became furious blaming the plant for all the health problems and he started persuading all the workers to vote Jay as the new union leader who could bring a change but Jay is reluctant about this. Jay is also suffering from Hematuria.\nIn the morning when Jay went to pick Digant up he saw police gathering outside. Police informed Jay that his friend Digant was murdered last night. Jay became very upset and he pledged to fulfil Digant's dream for the betterment of all the workers in the plant. So Jay went to the labour inspector Satish Parmar and told all the problems happening in the plant. Satish told according to law, the plant should arrange health check up for all workers every 2 years which was never done before. Jay understood the only way his voice to reach the higher management is to become the union leader. Soon Jay was voted to become the new leader of Kaamdar Union.\nThe labour inspector Mr. Parmar visited the plant and asked the Managing Director Mr. Ketul Somani to update all the safety standards, equipment and arrange workers health check up within 30 days else the plant will be shut down legally. Ketul couldn't bear the huge investment to fulfil those demands and decided to shut the plant.\nJay visited Prakash in the hospital. Prakash told Jay its an old trick of Ketul to shut down the plant. He will reopen the plant within a month giving bribe to the labour inspector and hiring all new workers. Prakash died later that day.\nJay just started working as an auto mechanic after the plant closed where he was repairing Dr. Rita's car. Dr. Rita was looking after Prakash when Jay had a good terms with her. Dr. Rita told Jay the secret about the forgery of medical reports of the workers by Apollo Chemicals in their hospital. With the help of Dr. Rita, Jay recovered the original medical reports of the workers and went to Parmar but he heeds no attention, Jay understood Parmar was sold out.\nJay and his co workers hired a novice lawyer to sue Ketul. Meanwhile Manoj came with an offer of 1 million to Jay to sort things out. Jay wanted to meet Ketul to further discuss on this offer where Jay recorded the conversation between them. He threatened to produce this evidence in court and left. Soon Jay was attacked & stabbed by Manoj and his goons however he survived.\nThe court of law declared verdict in favour of the workers. The accused were jailed. The plant was sold to another, safety had been updated and all the workers regained their jobs in the plant. Jay was promoted to Supervisor of the plant."
