In a quirky twist of fate, the professor meets with an accident and her memory travels back to the age of twenty. What follows is the total role reversal for the daughter, who does not know how to handle the situation. The only saving grace here is the psychiatrist who is treating her mother. On coming abreast with a completely different side of the mother's personality, she sets on a journey to find out about her mother's past. Will she be able to mend the troubled relationship she had with her mother? Will the psychiatrist be able to revive back the professor's memory?",
