        "Tensions soar high in a Rayalaseema village as Bhairav, a modest henchman of a leader Subbareddy and the latter's city-bred daughter Geetha fall in love. Their love story sparks a revolution among the suppressed lot to fight for a dignified existence, where there's no prince or pauper and every human is treated on merit and not caste.::Srivathsan Nadadhur",
        "Geetha (Irra Mor) comes from a family with a hardcore faction background. After finishing her studies, she returns to her village and falls in love with Bhairava (Dhananjaya), one of her dad's henchmen. This does not sit well with her father who orders that Bhairava be killed. Left with no choice, Bhairava and Geetha elope, facing a series of challenges as a result.::Shrinivas G. Kulkarni"
