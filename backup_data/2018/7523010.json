At the midnight mass, labor pains start and a baby girl is delivered. Josh names his sister Jenny - Jennifer. The flashback shows how he adores and takes care of his baby sister. Jenny is diagnosed with a congenital disease and is expected not to live long, depending on medicines all her life. The hospital expense takes a toll on the not so well off family and they struggle to keep food on the table. With so much happening in the house, Josh is dismissed from his school as he hasn't been performing well. His father who is aware of his love for machines takes him to a train yard to cheer him up.\nJosh's maternal uncle offers help to take Josh to Gulf and put him on some kind of vocation bringing some money to the household.

He finds out that it is his sister Jenny(Nazriya Nazim). He comes out of his dream at that point and goes to the van parked outside his house. To his surprise he does indeed find Jenny alive inside the van talking to him. He sits all night outside the van, he musters courage to ask who she is as he suspects some kind of foul play. The girl convinces that she is indeed Jenny and he is the only person who can see/hear/talk to her.\nStill flabbergasted about the whole situation, he goes inside and gets a cup of coffee as asked by Jenny. She tells him how hungry she is and Josh takes her to a roadside restaurant. They stop at a point on the road and see few children playing football.

He goes to Jenny's room and finds a desk where there are pictures of Jenny. Each of the picture has her standing/posing with Josh's photograph. He feels bad and goes back to the van and tells her of his decision of staying back for few more days.\nThe story now introduces Sophie(Parvathy), childhood sweetheart of Josh who went on to marry an alcoholic and suffered domestic violence and ended up divorcing him. She is staying with her father and his family. The family members are not happy that she divorced her husband and bad mouth her.

On one such day Coach gives Josh his field whistle seeing how Josh still seemed interested in football.\nOne day, Sophie and Josh spend time in the old house discussing about a book, when her family members come and take her away forcibly. Jenny tells Josh to help Sophie as he knows well how much of difference someone's support makes when one is alone. Josh all instigated reaches Sophie's house and calls her to come with him.
